# Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True

Someone may argue, “I am not self-interested. It is wrong that economics postulates that one is self-interested.” However, the postulates and axioms of science do not need any proof, which means they do not need to be real or genuine. However, they do need to be tested by facts. It means the theories deduced from them can explain phenomena in reality. If they can’t, the postulates and axioms must be modified or even rejected. Therefore, what can reject the postulate of self-interest is the explanation power of theories deducted from it instead of the truth or correctness of it.

Some experimental economists try to prove that the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong. However, they make an elementary logical mistake. In Lecture 2 about the methodology of science, it has been pointed out that if “A ⇒ B” is tested, then "not (B) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. One cannot conclude that “A ⇒ B” is wrong because “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”. Thus it is also seriously wrong to refute economics by experiments which refute the postulate of self-interest or rationality.

Let us consider this imaginary example to show that even if the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong, it can still explain or predict correctly.[^1]There are a group of people who are going to build gas stations, and there are three places available: the highway, the mountain and the desert. Suppose the construction costs are the same in these three places. According to the postulate of self-interest or rationality, economics predicts that they will build gas stations along the highway. Actually they are idiots, so it is totally wrong to postulate them to be self-interested or rational. Nevertheless, it does not matter! These idiots build gas stations just at random, so some of them build the gas stations in the mountain, while some of them in the desert. Of course, some idiots happen to build the gas stations along the highway. After some time, gas stations in the mountain and dessert go bankrupt because income earned cannot cover operational costs while those along the highway are prosperous and survive more in the business. The final result is the same as economic prediction. That is enough! It is not important whether they choose the place to build the gas stations by careful calculation or at random. It is essential that finally there is no gas station in the mountain or the desert, but there are along the highway, so facts have not refuted the economic prediction.

Milton Friedman (1912-2006) gave another similar example in his book “Price Theory”. Why do plants grow toward the sun? Biology has a theory to explain this phenomenon. The growth of leaves needs sunlight for photosynthesis, so more leaves are growing in the direction toward the sun and vice versa. As time passes, plants appear to grow toward the sun. Economics can also explain this phenomenon. How? Plants are postulated to be self-interested or rational, and the sunlight is beneficial to their growth, so they grow towards the sun. It is wrong to postulate plants to be self-interested or rational. How can plants think? It does not matter. The conclusion of economic explanation can be the same as that of biological explanation.

There is a new inter-discipline called bio-economics which uses the postulate of economics to deduce the theories explaining the biological phenomena. Moreover, the biological study also supports the postulate of economics. There is a famous book “The Extended Selfish Gene” in biology. It is well-known that species evolve through genetic mutations. Some mutations conform to the nature of selfishness, while some do not. Those genes without the nature of selfishness will be eliminated in natural selection, while those who are selfish survive. The survivors keep duplicating their genes and multiply, which makes selfishness continuously strengthened and inherited, thus ultimately determines that all species, including human, are selfish. Isn’t this process similar to the example of building gas stations by the idiots? Genetic mutations are random, just like the choices of the idiots. Nevertheless, natural selection determines that only the gas stations or genes conforming to the nature of selfishness can survive. It is well-known that Darwin’s idea is natural selection or survival of the fittest, but few know that the exposition inspired him about the self-interest of human in Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”.

However, it is not crucial whether a human is self-interested or not, or whether he is selfish due to the genes as “The Extended Selfish Gene” suggests, because self-interest is a postulate which does not need to be proved but must be accepted. If one does not accept it, then it is better not to study economics. Of course, one can invent a subject with the postulate of un-self-interest. Those who study this subject must accept it, but the theories deducted from it need to be tested by facts. If facts do not refute the theories, one will succeed in establishing a brand-new subject called Economics of Un-self-interest, while the economics now may be renamed as Economics of Self-interest. However, if facts refute one's theories, he has to modify or even abandon the postulate of un-self-interest. No one has been able to do so, because the theories deducted from the postulate of un-self-interest are easily refuted by facts and cannot be established as a subject.
In geometry, however, it did happen that new subjects were established by changing postulates. The geometry learned in middle school is “Euclidean geometry” because ancient Greek Euclid established it. There are five postulates in Euclidean geometry. Among them, the axiom derived from the fifth postulate is called “the parallel axiom” that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one”. However, in the 19th century, a Russian adopted a contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, at least two new lines can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” As a result, a new set of geometry theories without logical contradiction within it was deduced based on this new axiom. Later on, another German also deduced another set of new geometry theories without logical contradiction within it based on another contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, no new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” Eventually, the geometry based on the parallel axiom is called Euclidean geometry, while those based on alternative axioms other than the parallel one are collectively called non-Euclidean geometries.

Science is like this: In the first stage, there are one or several postulates which need not be proved, nor need it be true or real, but all in this discipline must accept and abide by the postulates. Anyone can establish new subjects based on different postulates, but whether they are successfully established must be tested by facts.
