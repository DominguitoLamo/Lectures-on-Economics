<p>The postulate of economics is &quot;Self-interest&quot; or more grandly &quot;Rationality&quot;.
The postulate of Self-interest means that human will try to achieve the best result with the lowest cost. It can be regarded as a biological instinct of animals. Under different circumstances, &quot;the least cost&quot; can be equivalent to the lowest price of money spent or the minimal resources consumed, while &quot;best results&quot; can be equivalent to the maximal income or revenue.</p>
<p>Caution: self-interest does not mean to benefit oneself by harming others unless harming others is the least costly way to realize one&apos;s self-interest goal. In fact, in most cases, in order to benefit oneself with the least cost, one can better act altruistically. As mentioned in Lecture 1, there is a famous example in the book, <em>Wealth of Nation</em> written by the founder of economics, Adam Smith. It says: the baker bakes bread for his good. He wants to earn money from buyers, but as a result, it also meets their needs. So, subjectively he is doing the job for his good, but objectively he is providing us with food, which benefits himself and others at the same time. He could rob people to get money, but that would put himself in jail. Also, he could beg for money, but few people would be willing to give beggar money for nothing, which means begging would not earn him as much as selling bread. After comparing the costs of the different ways of getting money, he chooses the one with the lowest cost and the highest income, which generally is selling bread. </p>
<p>Of course, if the place where baker lives had poor public security, robbery would become easier, because the risk of being caught would not be high enough. When committing crime costs less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. Thus, the choice between obeying the law and committing a crime is also the result of selfish-interest by measuring incomes and costs. Actually, beggars are said to have a higher income than bakers; however, not too much people are willing to be beggars, because bakers are more respectable, which means that the so-called income should not narrowly be considered as monetary income, but also contains reputation, dignity, and other non-monetary income. So, incomes include monetary ones and non-monetary. The same applies to costs. If one does not choose to be a beggar, the total incomes of beggar must be not higher than those of baker, and the total costs are not lower, which implies that self-interest dominates his behavior.</p>
<p>Let us think about this phenomenon more profound. Why do bakers earn more non-monetary incomes than beggars? Due to morality, bakers are respected while beggars are belittled. However, why is morality as such? Because bakers contribute to others and create new wealth by providing bread, while beggars do not contribute to others and create no wealth for society. They transfer wealth from those who donate. In other words, morality guides human to realize self-interest by altruism. That is precisely the reason why human need morality. Morality rewards self-interest acts by altruism, belittles those without benefits to others (such as begging) and condemns those by harming others (such as robbing). Therefore, robbery is not only sanctioned by law but also bears the pressure of moral condemnation which is a non-monetary cost. So morality increases the total costs of robbery. This is the same as the market guiding human to behave altruistically by price and the law preventing them from harming others by penalty.</p>
<p>Traditional morality makes it shameful to be a beggar, but modern social welfare essentially encourages people to be beggars. The original intention of social welfare is to help the poor, but the real effect is to support the lazy. The reason is straightforward: for one who is not sick or disabled, without the belittling of morality as a non-monetary cost, why not just sit there and live on relief. The national debt crisis of Greece tells this truth: the Greeks are not born to be lazy, and it is the long-term social welfare that makes them so. Also, it corrupts morality which praises self-reliance and belittles idleness. People feel no shame in taking it for granted to ask for money from the government, and scold government no matter it refuses or gives less than before. </p>
