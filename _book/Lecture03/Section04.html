<p>In Mainstream Economics or textbooks, there are often mistakes of being a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, because there are so many theories about &quot;irrationality&quot;. For instance, it is said that there is irrational exuberance when the stock market is rising too much. As mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, the meaning of self-interest and rationality is the same. If one is said to be irrational, it means he is un-self-interested, which is a conflict with the postulate of economics, so it is a serious mistake. Some economists would be cautious about saying that it is difficult to judge how much the stock index could be regarded as irrationality. However, it is not the problem of how to judge if the stock index is irrational or not. It is forbidden in economics to use irrationality to explain human behaviors, which is the same as it is forbidden in non-Euclidean geometry to use the parallel axiom.</p>
<p>No matter how crazily the price of a stock rises, it is rational. That sounds too ridiculous to accept. Nevertheless, the critical point is: that human is self-interested or rational does not mean they are sure to make correct choices. The crazily rising of a stock price is the result of the investors&apos; rational choices which may not be correct. Are rational or self-interested choices correct? Regardless of the cases mentioned before that committing crimes is rational but morally wrong behavior, here is another case. One is rational to make a choice, which means he believes he can achieve the best result with the lowest cost, but he may find he is wrong in the end. In other words, he has not achieved the best result or paid a higher price.</p>
<p>Take the stock investment as an example. One must believe the price of the stock he is going to buy would rise. However, the price of the stock may fall after he bought, so he suffered a loss. Was he irrational? No, he only made a mistake in his expectation of the stock price.</p>
<p>Moreover, why did he make a mistake? Because he is not the omniscient God! He thought that the stock price would rise, but it falls eventually. If he could know the price would fall in advance, of course, he would not choose to buy the stock. It is not because he is irrational, but because he does not know! If he knew the price would fall in advance, but he still chose to buy the stock, then the postulate of rationality would have been refuted by facts. That has never happened.</p>
<p>Human is rational, but he is not omniscient, which means ignorance is a constraint. Some have reliable inside information of the stock market, and know more than others or are less constrained, so their choices are more correct than those who are relatively ignorant. They are not more rational than others, but just under a different constraint. It is always the difference of constraints rather than rationality or irrationality that causes different human behaviors and their results.</p>
<p>Let us consider another example in reality for illustration. A student of economics posted in an economic forum that a classmate of his had not been going to take the postgraduate entrance examination. However, later he heard that someone not as good as he had passed the examination, so he completely changed his decision. The poster felt doubt that his classmate changed his decision just due to hearing such a piece of news. Is it right for economics to postulate human to be rational?</p>
<p>Has it refuted the postulate of rationality? Of course not. The classmate was not going to take the postgraduate entrance examination, of which he must have estimated the cost and benefit. He had to choose to spend time preparing for the exam or job hunting. Once he failed in the exam, neither had a job, he would suffer a significant loss. In the beginning, he estimated the exam to be very difficult. It must be because of the information he had that made him believe that he had little chance to pass. He rationally gave up the exam after the calculation the cost and benefit. Later, he got some new information that someone not as good as he had passed the exam, so he adjusted his estimation about the exam, which means the constraints have changed. Thanks to the new information, he now knows better about the difficulty of the exam or becomes less ignorant than he was before. Along with the change of constraints, his choice or behavior also changed. If he knew that a postgraduate degree was better than a graduate job and he could pass the exam, but he still did not change his choice, then we would have arrived in conclusion that postulate of rationality has been refuted. Remember: it is always the change of constraints other than the postulate of self-interest or rationality that can be used to explain human&apos;s behaviors.</p>
<p>Some economists suggest that the reasons why self-interested or rational people cannot make correct choices are divided into ignorance and uncertainty. However, they are the same because uncertainty means it is impossible to completely know the future, which is equivalent to the ignorance of the future.</p>
<p>Ignorance is also a constraint which is defined as transaction cost in economics. Transaction cost is a fundamental but complicated concept, so it will not be explained in detail until the later lecture in this book. However, this concept is so indispensable that we need to frequently apply it to almost every issue of economics before that lecture. A reader can take his time to comprehend it by observing how it is applied.</p>
<p>One kind of transaction costs is information cost which is the cost of acquiring information. Ignorance is precisely due to information cost. One would choose to be ignorant rationally when there is too high information cost. Ignorance is a rational choice! One can benefit from knowing more, for which he has to pay formation cost. If the information cost is higher than the benefit, it is not worth knowing more, so it is rational to choose to be ignorant. When one becomes more enlightened, he is constrained less by information cost.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, uncertainty is the ignorance of the future. Human has made great efforts to predict the future, including weather prediction, earthquake prediction and even such unscientific means as fortune-telling. Great efforts imply tremendous information costs. To sum up, information cost is one kind of transaction costs, and transaction cost is a significant constraint that would affect human&apos;s behaviors. </p>
