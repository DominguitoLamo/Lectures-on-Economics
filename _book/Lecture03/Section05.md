# Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest

Economics postulates human to be self-interested. It does not matter whether it is true or false. What does matter is facts have not rejected the results deduced from it. If the government does not take this postulate into account, or even just not carefully enough, there would be unexpected effects of policy implementation which would even run counter to the original intentions. For example, social welfare is intended to help the poor and the weak, but it makes them lazy and even corrupts morality. There are such counterproductive policies everywhere in reality. The policy-makers should be cautious: do not just think that the original intentions are good, but try to have a guess what the self-interested people would respond with a countermeasure.

>Air-bags reduce, on average, the severity of auto injuries and the risk of death from motor accidents. However, given that additional safety margin, it might well be rational for motorists to drive more aggressively!

>Is such an adaptation observed? Steven Peterson, George Hoffer, and Edward Millner examined statistics collected by the state of Virginia about fatal two-car accidents in 1993.   In 30 such accidents, one car was equipped with an air-bag, and the other was not. The accident reports identified in each case the supposed "initiator" the party was driving more aggressively. The table indicates that in 22 of the 30 accidents (73%) the initiators drove cars with air-bags, although only 50% of the cars involved in accidents were air-bag equipped. So, the indications are, having an air-bag increased the likelihood of a driver to initiate an accident.

>Any single bit of evidence such as this can only be indicative, not conclusive. Moreover, even if entirely valid, these results do not necessarily imply that regulations requiring air-bags are inadvisable. Although drivers of airbag-equipped vehicles may indeed be more inclined to take risks, the increased aggressiveness may not entirely cancel out the overall beneficial safety effect of air-bags.

This reading material illustrates that air-bags are equipped to reduce the damage of accidents, the intention of which is good. However, the result is out of expectation. Because of the reduction of the damage of a car accident, drivers become aggressive in driving. Under the constraint of the cars equipped with air-bags, the costs of aggressive driving decrease from severe disability or even death to minor injury or disability. As a result, drivers tend to drive faster. The risk of severe damage caused by a car accident is reduced, while that of the happening of car accidents increases. So the number of victims of accidents may increase. The result is uncertain for drivers, but for pedestrians without air-bags on their backs, they are sure to be harmed. Then for the whole society, air-bags equipped in cars may do more harm than good.

In order to eliminate crimes, some have suggested a death penalty to be imposed on all crimes regardless of their severities. However, once the severity of the penalty was out of line with that of crime, the costs and benefits faced by a criminal would be distorted, and he would make distorted choices. Just imagine what would happen if a nation did do so. The criminal rate would certainly plunge, and minor offences such as stealing would almost disappear, but serious crimes such as murder would increase. Why? Suppose now one was out of money and with no option but to steal or rob. Meanwhile, the police's detection rate cannot be 100%. In other words, one might not be caught and punished. So what kind of crimes would one opt to commit? Will one opt for petty stealing or robbing a bank? The consequences of being caught in both cases would be the same: death penalty. The same costs with different revenues, what would one choose? The answer is obvious. The legislation should base on objective analysis instead of passion, or else there would be horrible consequences. No nation has implemented such a death penalty, which implies it is unfit to survive.
