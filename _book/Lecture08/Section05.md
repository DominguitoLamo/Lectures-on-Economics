# Section 5: The Role of the Law of Demand as An axiom

What is the relationship between other factors in the law of demand and the constraints mentioned before? In reality, human’s behavior (choice) is constrained by many factors. Think of Rousseau's words: Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains. If the so-called chains need a clear definition, they are constraints. There is such thing as unconstrained situation, so neither is there is such things as unconstrained freedom.

From the point of view of economics, self-interest is the most important restriction on human’s behavior, but it is a postulate which needs not to be true. Only self-interest is not enough to constrain human’s behavior. It has been pointed out in Lecture 4 that if there were no scarcity, human would not need to choose even if they were self-interested. There are also constraints that restrict human’s behavior along with self-interest. Constraints are objective facts which are essentially different from self-interest. It is the unchanged postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. However, there may be tens of thousands of constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. It is impossible and unnecessary for economics to care about all of them. Only some of constraints need to be singled out to analyze which is called endogenous variables (such as price in the law of demand), while other constraints should be treated as exogenous variables (other factors).

It has been repeatedly stressed that it is the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that are used to explain phenomena in economics, which is precisely the law of demand. The price in the law of demand is a fact, so if widely interpreted, it can be regarded as constraint. Quantity demanded is individual’s intention, so it is a psychological factor, not a fact. There is a negative correlation between price and quantity demanded, or the demand curve slopes downwards, which implies the postulate of self-interest. That is why in economics the demand curve must slope downwards and no exceptions are allowed (no demand curve can slope upwards), because if there were exceptions, it would be inconsistent with the postulate of self-interest.

Thus, the law of demand is not only a theory which can only explain the consumers’ choices in the product market, but also an axiom of economics, and has strong explanatory power. Price can be regarded as constraint, so any constraint that plays a key role in determining the behavior to be explained can be put into the law of demand as price. When there is more than one key constraint, but just one of them is singled out to analyze, the other constraints will be regarded as “other factors” to keep unchanged. In fact, all the phenomena that have been explained previously with the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints can be rewritten with the law of demand. The law of demand may not be mentioned literally, but it has actually been always applied and followed in any explanation or analysis in economics. And only such economic explanation or analysis is correct when it is consistent with the law of demand, the axiom of economics.
