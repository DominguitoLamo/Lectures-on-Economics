# Lecture 15: Market Structure â€“ Price-Taking

After the introduction of the theory about cost, next it is the market faced by producers should be analyzed.

In MSE, product market is separated from factor market. In product market, producers are the suppliers, while individuals or households are the demanders. By contrast, in factor market, producers are the demanders, while individuals or households are the suppliers. However, as will be discussed in the later lecture about production factors, if the transaction cost is low enough and the production is organized by piece-rate contract, product market cannot be separated from factor market. The market structure to be discussed in this and the next lecture is applicable to any markets, and product market is taken as an example here.
