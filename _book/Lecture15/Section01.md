# Section 1: The Definition of Price-Taking

As for market structure, in MSE, it is divided into two categories: “pure competition” (perfect competition) and “monopoly”. The former is also called “Price-Taking”, because producers can only passively take the price prevailing in the market. The latter is also called “Price-Making” because producers can indirectly make price by changing outputs.

However, we advocate that the former should only be called “Price-Taking” rather than “pure competition” or “perfect competition”, while the latter should be called “Price-Searching” rather than “monopoly”, and the term “Price-Taking” is used to describe another behavior of making use of information cost to increase price.

Why?

Firstly, the term “pure competition” or “perfect competition” is misleading. As mentioned in Lecture 4, competition is everywhere in a society which is not Robinson’s one-man world. So even under the so-called monopoly market structure, there is still competition, just the form of which is different from that under the price-taking market structure. The problem is what “pure” or “perfect” means. No matter what market structure is, any competition must be restricted by the legal system protecting PPRs, and not completely free, so the term “pure” or “perfect” is meaningless.

Secondly, the concept of monopoly in MSE is seriously wrong, which will be the theme of the next lecture. Why the term “price-making” should be replaced by “price-searching” will be also explained in detail in the next lecture.

In this lecture, we will introduce the market structure of price-taking first. What is price-taking? It is most appropriate to define it by the shape of the demand curve. When the demand curve faced by a single producer is a flat line[^1], it is the market structure of price-taking, because he can only take the price where the demand curve intersects with the vertical axis representing the price. If he set the price higher than it, consumers will turn to other producers, so he cannot sell out a single unit. And if he set the price lower than it, he suffers a loss from the perspective of opportunity cost, because he can sell out numerous units at the market price which is the opportunity cost of selling at other prices). In other words, no producers can set price higher than the market price and will set price lower than the market price, so they actually have no right in setting price and can only take the market price.

The market structure of price-taking is actually very rare, because it appears only when the following two conditions are satisfied:

(1) All producers supply the same products among which there is no difference in type, quality, or even location. Even if there is slight difference, the price will be different. If two stores sell exactly the same products, but one is located in a residential area and the other is far away from the residents, the former can charge a higher price, which is the rent of the location, making the same product more valuable.

(2) There is no information cost. When information cost is high, the producer can benefit from his knowing more than the consumers by price-making, which is due to the rent of information.

Why is the demand curve faced by a single producer in a price-taking market a flat line? The explanation of MSE is that in the so-called pure competition, there are countless producers and consumers, so a single producer accounts for only a tiny share of the whole market. In other words, what a single producer faces is only a small point on a demand curve of the whole market sloping downwards. If enlarged, that point seems almost like a flat line.

However, there is a serious mistake in this explanation in that the quantity of producers and consumers in the market is actually irrelevant. As will be pointed out in the next lecture, it is a serious mistake for MSE to define monopoly as “there is only one producer in the market”. The quantity of producers in the market has nothing to do with whether the market structure is price-taking or price-searching (monopoly). Even if there is only one producer in the market, it can be price-taking. And even if there are numerous producers in the market, it is completely possible to be price-searching as long as there is high information cost. Not only those who are in the market and be observable are competitors, but also those who are outside the market but are eager to come in are potential competitors. Therefore, what matters is not the quantity of producers in the market, which will be discussed in detail in the next lecture.
