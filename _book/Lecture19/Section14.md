# Section 14: The Monetary System Pegging Money to the Price Index of a Basket of Tradable Goods

The central bank can select some goods that are important to life and production, puts them into a basket in a certain proportion, and calculates the price of the basket of goods. For example, RMB100 can buy the combination of goods in this basket. The central bank does not need to the basket of goods as reserves, but only needs to keep an eye on the price of it. If the price rises, the central bank should adopt tight money policy to make the price fall. If the price falls, the central bank should adopt expansionary monetary policy to make the price rise. Take the gold standard as an example. It is actually a special case of the basket of goods, which means there is only one good (gold) in that basket, so the price of the basket is that of gold.

Some may wonder if it is price control. No! What is controlled here is the price level, not the relative price (real price) of goods. There is a numerical example to illustrate that this monetary system pegging to a basket of goods has not influence the relative prices of goods.

Suppose the initial price of pork is RMB10/kg and that of rice is RMB5/kg, and there are 5 kg of meat and 10 kg of rice in a basket with the price of RMB100. If the price of pork rises to RMB20/kg, the price of the will also rise to RMB150. The central bank should reduce money supply to make the price of the basket fall from RMB150 back to RMB100. Assume that the new price of pork after monetary policy is x and that of rice is y, the equations should be $\frac{150}{100} = \frac{20}{x}$ and $\frac{150}{100} = \frac{5}{y}$, and the solutions are $x = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33$ and $y = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33$. Due to the change of money supply, the price of the basket returns to RMB100, while the price of pork correspondingly falls from RMB20 to RMB13.33, and that of rice from RMB5 to RMB3.33.

Obviously, the central bank does not control the price of meat and rice. What it does is to control the value of money. Although the monetary prices (nominal prices) of the goods in the basket rise or fall to keep the total price be RMB100, the relative price of them has not changed. Before the monetary policy adjusting the money supply, the price of the basket is RMB150, and the relative price of pork and rice is 4: 1 (20: 5). After the monetary policy making the price of the basket fall back to RMB100, the relative price of pork and rice is still 4:1($\frac{40}{3} : \frac{10}{3}$). Therefore, the monetary system pegging to a basket of goods is not price control at all, and what the central bank changes is only the monetary price of good.

Fixing the nominal price of a good through monetary policy is totally different from the price control mentioned in Lecture 9. The following means seem to fix the price of a good: (1) Administrative instruction directly prohibiting suppliers from pricing above the regulated price (price control), (2) Demand control (such as rationing system and purchase restriction policy), (3) Increasing supply, and (4) controlling money supply.

No economist has ever regarded the means (4) as price control, because the essence of it is to stabilize the value of money, and what is controlled is actually the price of money, not that of any good. The price of any good should not be controlled except that of money, because one of the functions of money is a ruler of value and the length of a ruler should not be changing. In other words, those who doubt that the monetary system begging to a basket of goods is price control are wrong in criticizing the means (4) with the consequences of means (1).[^1]

One may notice that the price of this basket of goods is actually a price index calculated by multiplying the price of the goods in the basket by their proportions. The CPI is also a price index based on a basket of goods (consumption goods). What is the difference between them?
Let us introduce the calculation of CPI and how to use it to measure inflation first, and then explain the defect of it. Continue the above example of the basket of pork and rice, and suppose it is precisely the basket that makes up CPI. Take 2010 as the base period when the price of pork is RMB10/kg and that of rice is RMB5/kg. If the price of pork rises to RMB20/kg in 2012, CPI is the current price of a basket of goods divided by that in base period: $\frac{150}{100} X 100 = 150$. If the CPI of 2011is 140 that is must also be based on 2010, the inflation rate from 2011 to 2012 is $\frac{150 - 140}{140} X 100\% = 7.14%$.

In reality, the basket of goods that makes up CPI cannot be so simple. Take China as an example, food accounts for 31.79%, alcohol and tobacco 3.49%, housing 17.22%, communications 9.95%, personal medical and health products 9.64%, clothing 8.52%, household equipment and maintenance services 5.64%, entertainment, education and cultural products and services 13.75% of the CPI basket. As for the base period, it changes every five years, keeping the same cycle as China’s “five-year plan”. For example, the CPI from 2011 onwards is based on 2010.

The monthly CPI data in financial reports reflect the year-on-year growth, which are calculated by comparing with the CPI in the same month of last year, thus directly equivalent to inflation rate. For example, the CPI in March 2012 rose 3.6% on year-on-year base, which is calculated by comparing with the CPI in March 2011. The other data is on month-on-month base, which is calculated by comparing with the CPI of the previous month (February). The data on year-on-year base rather than on month-on-month base can eliminate the influence of seasonal factors. For example, in January or February, there is Spring Festival in China with much more consumption than the other months in a year, which will push up the price level, resulting in a lower month-on-month growth in CPI of the following month.

In addition to CPI, there is also a price index called PPI (Producer’s Price Index) that is calculated by the factory price of the product (instead of the retail price directly faced by consumers). Obviously, PPI is closely related to CPI and is theoretically a leading indicator of CPI.

Many countries use CPI to measure inflation rate, so to control inflation with monetary policy is to control CPI. In other words, the currencies of these countries are theoretically pegged to the price of a basket of goods that makes up CPI. So what is so special about the revised version of Zhu’s system that the target is changed from the exchange rate to the price index of a basket of goods?

The key lies in the fact that the target must be clearly visible (measurable). There are many problems in CPI.

(1) The basket that makes up CPI contains goods with varying quality. As known to all, the prices of such goods as pork with different qualities can be rather different. The case of real estate is even more serious. A same house, built in prime locations of a city or in remote villages, will have totally different price. The absolute difference of quality is not so important, because CPI measures the change of price during a period of time, so long as the goods keep the same quality during that period, there will be no problem. However, the problem is precisely that the quality of goods will also change during the period. With economic development and technological progress, the quality of goods will usually rise, and the price should also rise, not because there is more money supply. If a society’s production and technological capabilities have generally improved, the qualities of the goods will generally increase, so the prices will generally rise. CPI will mistakenly measure it as inflation. For example, from 1996 to 2000, the CPI in China showed a slight deflation in China (such as -1.4 in 1999). In fact, the qualities of goods in China generally increased during that period, so the data of CPI seriously underestimated the deflation.

(2) It is difficult to deal with the new products for CPI. If there are new products such as computers and mobile phones, money can buy more kinds of goods, which implies the purchasing power or value of money has increased. Therefore, CPI will overestimate the inflation because it again mistakenly measures the rise in value of money as inflation.

Attention: a rise in price is not the same as inflation. Inflation is caused by the increase in the quantity of money out of line with that in the quantity of goods, and it will but it will lead to a rise in price. However, a rise in price is not necessarily due to inflation, but may also be due to the general rise in quality or the appearance of new products. If all rises in price are regarded as inflation, to control inflation may mistakenly become suppress quality improvement and product innovation. In addition, at the beginning of the reform and opening up, China had experienced a general rise in price during the period of abolishing the price control. Neither was it was inflation, but the controlled price returned (increased) to the market equilibrium.

(3) The statistics of CPI is very time-consuming, so the CPI of a month cannot be known and released to the public until the following month, thus causing a time lag of recognition in monetary policy.

In other words, CPI is not clearly visible enough to be a measurable target. What the central bank needs is a good price index like the exchange rate in the foreign exchange market or interest rate in the interbank market that all can see immediately every minute and even every second. The goods put into the basket must be carefully selected. One of the principles for choosing the goods in the basket is that the quality of the goods is stable and clear, so that the prices are visible every minute and even every second. The other principle is that the goods are representative, which means they play an important role in a country’s life and production, so they can represent the value of a large number of goods.

Those most appropriate are commodities in futures market and some in wholesale market (such as cement). Although there are hundreds of millions of commodities in the world, the raw materials needed to manufacture them are basically those in futures market and wholesale market (such as oil, steel, cotton, etc). As long as the prices of these raw materials are stable, those of hundreds of millions of commodities are also stable. Moreover, even if there are new products, the raw materials used to manufacture them are not new, so the problem of new products CPI cannot deal with is not a problem anymore. The central bank does not need to collect the information of prices of millions of commodities, but only needs to collect that of hundreds of raw materials that is visible in futures market and wholesale market every minute and even every second!

Thus, the basket of goods is selected, and the proportions of these raw materials are determined according to their proportion in a country’s production and life. The central bank then calculates the price index of the basket, and keeps an eye on it to adjust the money supply to stabilize it on the desirable level. The central bank can use computers to connect with major futures markets and wholesale markets in the world, directly input relevant price data from those markets, and publicize the price index of the basket every minute, so that the public can see clearly that RMB is firmly pegged to this index. It is as feasible as the index of foreign exchange market, and the fact that China successfully fought against the international speculators in the financial crisis of 1997 has eloquently proved the effectiveness of this monetary system.

Once RMB is pegged to the price index of the basket of tradable goods, the exchange rate control can be completely abolished, allowing the exchange rate between RMB and all foreign currencies to float freely. If the exchange rate changes, it reflects the change in the value of foreign currency instead of RMB, because the value of RMB has been tightly pegged to the value of the basket and will not change.
It is precisely the best way for the internationalization of RMB. After pegged to the price index of a basket of tradable goods, foreign exchange control can be abolished, so RMB becomes a convertible international currency. The control on the exchange rate between RMB and the US dollar can naturally be abolished. If there is a depreciation of US dollar, it is the problem of US dollar, not the appreciation of RMB. And the US has no reason to accuse China of manipulating the exchange rate any more. For the other countries, the best choice for them must be to peg their currencies to RMB instead of the US dollar, because the value of RMB is pegged to the real source of money. As long as China strictly abide by the system of pegging to the price index of a basket of tradable goods that is publicized every minute, there will never be any risk of overprinting RMB, so there will never depreciation of RMB.
Reviewing the two major difficulties of a good monetary system, we can better understand the advantages of this monetary system pegging money to the price index of a basket of tradable goods.

For the first difficulty, if a government is determined not to abide by the discipline of stabilizing the monetary value, there is no way for any monetary system to stop it. However, as long as a government pretends to abide the monetary discipline, under this monetary system, it will be very difficult for the government to overprint money secretly. Under the fiat monetary system, people do not know whether the government has secretly overprinted money until the inaccurate CPI is released at least a month later. By contrast, under this monetary system, the price index of the basket is visible every minute and even every second, which makes it very difficult for the government to cheat.

For the second difficulty, this monetary system cleverly goes round the difficulty of knowing the quantity of money directly. It monitors the price index of a selected basket of goods with stable quality instead of knowing the specific quantity of money. A water supply company also faces similar difficulty in natural science. It has to transport water to tens of thousands of households through water pipes, and the water pipes from the water supply company to the households are also very complicated. It is impossible to accurately know the specific quantity of water needed to ensure that each household has water flowing out when turning on the tap. The water supply company does not try to know the specific quantity of water needed, but widely installs water pressure gauges, and then continuously supplies water into the pipe until the water pressure meets the standard. If the gauges indicate that the water pressure is lower than the standard, the water supply company will inject more water into the pipe to increase the water pressure. If the gauges indicate that the water pressure is higher than the standard, the water supply company will draw water back from the pipe to reduce the water pressure. Thus, even if the city continues to expand and the pipe network has to expand with it, the water supply company does not need to continuously get to know the specific quantity of water needed, but only needs to keep an eye on the water pressure gauges to ensure that the water pressure is stabilized at the standard level. It is logically similar to the monetary system pegging money to the price index of a basket of tradable goods which converts information difficult to know to that easy to know, thus greatly reducing the information cost of stabilizing the monetary value.

So far, it is the monetary system with the least comprehensive transaction cost, so is the best one!

[^1]: The price control criticized by economists do not include means (4), neither include means (3). In fact, increasing supply is the most correct means to fix price that is effective and has no adverse consequences. However, increasing supply is usually subject to resource constraints, production cycle and etc., so it is often impossible to be adopted.
