# Section 12: The Formation of Zhu’s Monetary System

The best monetary system comes from the improvement of the monetary system formed during the period of Zhu Rongji in charge of the central bank in China. To understand Zhu’s monetary system, we must first know how it came into being.

After Deng Xiaoping’s southern tour in 1992, China had been in another period of rapid economic growth. However, during this period, there had been serious inflation until 1996 due to the prevalence of power lending. The CPI(Consumer’s Price Index, an important index commonly used to measure inflation rate) rose as high as 14.7% in 1993, and in 1994, it even reached to the highest 24.1% since 1949.

Why was the inflation rate so high in China at that time? According to the monetary theory introduced in this lecture, the direct reason must be that too much money had been issued and was out of line with the growth of real economy. But why? Why did the Chinese government not control the growth of money supply? Because the powerful men and their relatives and friends (the so-called “Prince’s Party”) relied on their power to borrow money from banks. At that time, although the People’s Bank of China had already performed the functions of a central bank (including printing paper money, controlling money supply, and supervising financial institutions) as state agency instead of a commercial firm, it still engaged in the business of commercial banks including loaning. Thus, when the powerful men and their relatives and friends wanted to do business, they would force the People’s Bank of China to lend money to them.

A central bank is a state agency, and should engage in commercial loan, but the central bank system of China was not perfect at that time. Here, by the way, we will introduce the history of the development of banks in China after 1949. During 1949 and 1978, there was only one bank (the people’s bank of China, PBC) in China besides the bank of China that specialized in foreign business. PBC was both a state agency and a commercial bank, which was a typical example of mixing up the functions of the government and enterprises. After the reform and opening up in 1978, PBC had gradually separated some of the operations of commercial banks out to form three of the four major state-owned banks in China (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and China Construction Bank). However, until 1993, PBC was still able to lend money out, so the powerful men and their relatives and friends to put pressure on it to lend money to them. As a result, PBC had involuntarily lent out a lot of loans, which increased the money supply and created serious inflation at that time.

Because of the bitter experience of overprinting “gold yuan” note on the eve of the collapse of the KMT regime before 1949, the Chinese people abhor super-inflation and the Chinese government is also deeply aware that the consequence of super-inflation will affect social stability and even overthrow the national regime. Zhu was appointed as the president of PBC in June 1993. Shortly after he took office, Zhu vigorously promoted the reform of PBC by completely stopping the commercial banking business of loaning. On March 18, 1995, the Law of PBC was passed. For the first time, the status of PBC as the central bank of China was clarified in the form of national legislation. Since 1996, the inflation rate had dropped sharply. In 1998 and 1999, there was even slight deflation according to CPI. In fact, there was more serious deflation than what CPI reflected.

At the same time, the exchange rate between US dollar and RMB dropped from more than 5.5 in 1992 to about 8.6 in 1994 when inflation was at the peak, implying China’s high domestic inflation rate. However, after that, although the inflation rate dropped sharply and even turned to deflation, the exchange rate did not fluctuate significantly and had remained stable at 8.27 for a long time since 1997. As all know, 1997 was the year when the Southeast Asian financial crisis broke out, all currencies in Southeast Asian countries depreciated sharply against the US dollar, including the Thai baht depreciating 39%, Korean won 36%, Indonesian rupiah 72% and Singapore dollar 61% respectively. RMB of China not only remained stable during the crisis, but even appreciated slightly compared with 8.29 in 1996.

Why could RMB withstand the impact of Southeast Asian financial crisis? Although Zhu was no longer the president of PBC in 1997, he had set the mechanism of stabilizing the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB at about 8 before he left. A considerable part of China’s economic growth comes from export, and the main trade partner of China is the US, so the stabile exchange rate between RMB and US dollar is important to maintain a stable foreign exchange environment for export enterprises in China. As mentioned in Section 3, internal inflation is precisely the same as external currency depreciation, so Zhu stabilized the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB when he tried to control domestic inflation in the mid 1990s by adopting a system of pegging to the US dollar.

One may ask, during the financial crisis in 1997, the Southeast Asian countries also wanted to stabilize the exchange rates between the US dollar and their currencies, but why could China make it while they could not? The secret is the Southeast Asian countries used the foreign exchange reserves of US dollar to stabilize the exchange rates, while China used monetary policy!

Suppose there are international speculators attacking a country’s currency, which means they sell out the country’s currency in large quantities in the foreign exchange market, causing the supply to exceed the demand and the price (the exchange rate between the US dollar and the currency) to fall. The central bank usually fights against the attack of the speculators by selling out the foreign exchange reserves of US dollar to buy in the domestic currency, equalizing the supply and demand to keep the exchange rate stable. However, a country’s foreign exchange reserves are limited and will run out quickly, and then the central bank can do nothing but surrender to speculators and let the currency depreciate. By contrast, PBC or China’s central bank does differently. It uses the monetary policy of reducing the money supply domestically! Precisely because it is a domestic monetary policy, there is no need to use foreign exchange reserves of US dollar.

Zhu came up with this system to stabilize the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB not to fight against the speculators during the financial crisis in 1997, but to control domestic inflation in 1993 when he became the president of PBC. Because what he was thinking about was how to decrease the inflation rate, the tight money policy to reduce the money supply was, of course, the direct solution. Since internal inflation is the same as the external currency depreciation, it is natural to invent this system of directly controlling inflation and indirectly stabilizing the exchange rate by monetary policy.

When the Southeast Asian financial crisis in 1997 broke out, the foreign exchange reserves in China were as high as 139.89 billion US dollars, almost double of those two years ago (1995). Thailand, as the first Southeast Asian country to be attacked by the speculators, had only 00-35 billion US dollars as foreign exchange reserves. In the first half of 1997, 20 billion US dollars were sold out in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the exchange rate between the US dollar and Thai baht, and more than 4 billion US dollars were sold out in May alone. Chinese government had witnessed how the speculators attacked the currencies of Southeast Asian countries and knew that even such foreign exchange reserves might not be sufficient to resist the speculators.

In fact, even if the speculators were not taken into account, it was estimated that Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines had experienced a sharp change from a net inflow of 93.8 billion US dollars in 1996 to a net outflow of 24.6 billion US dollars in 1998, reversing the capital by more than 100 billion US dollars. In other words, just the flight of the private capital (in order to avoid the risk of depreciation, rather than deliberately attacking the currencies) was enough to exhaust almost all the foreign exchange reserves in these countries.

Therefore, the Chinese government wisely chose not to sell out a large amount of US dollar in the foreign exchange market to fight against the speculators, but to firmly control the money supply domestically by tight money policy, keeping the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB at the level of 8.27. RMB is the currency of China, so PBC has full autonomy in releasing and recovering it, which is different from that the other Southeast Asian countries used their reserves of US dollar to fight against the speculators. The US dollar is the currency of the US, and cannot be as many as these Southeast Asian countries wanted to have.

Thus, China not only stabilized the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB, but also did not cost a cent of foreign exchange reserves of US dollar in 1997, with the system invented by Zhu.
