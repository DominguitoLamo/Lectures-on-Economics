# Section 2: The Value of Good VS the Value of Money

Since money is a ruler used to measure the value of good, what is the value of good? The value of good is the “use value” introduced in Lecture 10 and the “wealth” introduced in Lecture 18. It comes from the fact that good can be used to make human live and live better. For example, bread can appease hunger and make human live. In addition, bread can be made very delicious, so human take it not only to fill the stomach, but also to enjoy delicious food, which makes human live better. Similarly, a house can shelter human from the wind and rain, which makes human live. A house can be spacious, comfortable and beautiful, which makes human live better.

There is also value of money.

In ancient times, the precious metals such as gold and silver were mainly used as money. There is value of gold or silver as a good. For example, they can be used as bowls or plates, which makes human live. They can also be used as ornaments, which make human live better. Obviously the value of gold or silver as money is quite different.

In modern society, money is only a piece of paper printed specially. If it were not printed as money, the value is extremely low. Once printed as money, the value is equal to the number printed on the paper, much higher than the value of a piece of paper.

It is obvious that the value of money does not come from the use value of the material as an ordinary good, but from the value of the goods it can exchange for. In other words, what human really need is not money, but the goods it can exchange for.

There is such a fable. There was a king who was crazy about gold. One day God gave him a “gold finger”, and anything touched by this gold finger will turn into gold. The king was so happy that he touched everything around him, and turned them all into gold. After a while, his daughter came in, and he hugged her happily. As soon as his gold finger touched her, the living girl became a lifeless gold one. When the king felt hungry, but as soon as he touched the meal, it also turned into gold. At the end of the story, the king starved to death in a room full of gold with grief for his daughter.
The original purpose of this fable is to warn people not to be so greedy, but there is actually profound implication of monetary theory in it. What human really need is not money (whether it is gold or paper money), but those that can be exchanged with the money and can help human live and live better. The real value, or real wealth, comes from the tangible goods like the meal and intangible goods like the love of the daughter in the above fable. Human needs money only because money can exchange for all kinds of goods, which are much more convenient than barter. Therefore, strictly speaking, money itself is worthless, and the value of it comes from what it can exchange for.

The term “financial derivative” sounds very mysterious, and can be only found in countries with highly developed modern finance. In fact, money is the first financial derivative invented by human, and it is as common as air that few realize it. Financial derivatives refer to those whose values derive from real goods. The value of money precisely derives from the goods it exchanges for.

The division of “fictitious economy” and “real economy” seems to be the result of highly developed modern financial system. In fact, once money is invented by human, there has been fictitious economy (monetary economy) in human society. The economy only with barter is a pure real economy. When there is money helping to make exchange convenient, a monetary economy has been established on the basis of the real economy.
