# Section 1: The Functions of Money

First of all, what are the functions of money? In other words, why do human need money?

As we all know, in ancient times, there was no money in transactions, and people exchanged a good for another good (barter), which is very troublesome, because what one offers is not necessarily what another needs. For example, A has bread and wants to exchange for B’s water, while B may not need A’s bread but C’s pen. Even if A does not need C’s pen, he has to exchange his bread for C’s pen first, and then exchange the pen for B’s water that is what he really needs. However, C may not need A’s bread but a book. A has to try to find someone who has the book C needs and at the same time needs his bread…How troublesome it is to match the supply and demand of the transaction!

It is more troublesome that even if B needs A’s bread, but he will need it tomorrow, while A has bread today and cannot wait until tomorrow because the bread will perish tomorrow. In other words, in addition to matching the kinds of goods, the transaction also needs to match the time of goods, and some goods are perishable and cannot wait.

What is the solution? The solution that human found in ancient times was money. A good is singled out and can be exchanged for all other goods, and it becomes a universal equivalent or money. Take the example above, A has bread and wants to exchange for B’s water, while what B needs is a pen instead of bread. With money, A just tries to find someone who needs his bread and sell it to him in exchange for money, and then A pays the money to buy B’s water. Attention: what A needs is in fact not money, but water. But the buyer of the bread does not need to have water, but money. A is willing to accept money instead of water because he knows that B who has water is also willing to accept money. And B is willing to accept money because he also knows that when he pays money to someone who has a pen, that person also accepts money. Everyone accepts money because he knows that all others also accept money. Thus, there is no need to match the supply and demand of the transaction any more, neither does the time of good need to be matched because money will not perish. A will sell out the perishable bread today and exchange for imperishable money, and when he needs something else at any time, he can exchange the money for it.

In conclusion, what are the functions of money?

(1) Money is a medium of exchange that makes it convenient.

(2) Money is a store of value. When one sells a good in exchange for money, the value of the good is temporarily stored in the money. Later, he can exchange the money, actually the value stored in it, for another good.

(3) Money is a ruler of value. In barter, suppose a piece of bread can be exchanged for two bottles of water, which means the value of a piece of bread is equivalent to two bottles of water. What is more, suppose a book can be exchanged for ten pieces of bread. What is the value of the book? There are two versions: one is ten pieces of bread, and the other is twenty bottles of water. There are only three kinds of goods in this example, and there have been two versions of the value of a good. In reality, there are thousands of goods, and how troublesome it can become! If all goods are only exchanged for money, there will be only one version of the values of them. Take the example above, suppose one bottle of water is RMB1, a piece of bread is RMB2, and a book is RMB20, which is the same as the exchange value of them in barter, but now is much more convenient. In other words, money becomes a ruler. Different from the ordinary ruler that is used to measure the length of object, money as a ruler is used to measure the value of good.
