<p>Open market operation is only a monetary policy tool, not the monetary policy target. As far as the ultimate target of monetary policy is concerned, all the central banks want to control the price level (inflation), but the question what should be the intermediate target of regulation is quite controversial.</p>
<p>Monetary school has always advocated money supply as the intermediate target, but since Greenspan became the chairman of the Fed, he liked to regulate the interest rate in the federal fund market (the interbank market of the US). The selection of intermediate target should consider measurability, controllability and correlation. The interest rate in the interbank market is so obvious that it does be measurable, and it is also controllable through open market operation. However, correlation is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Those who take interest rate as the intermediate target believe that the rise in interest rate reflects the decline in money supply relative to demand, and vice versa, so the level of interest rate is related to the quantity of money supply. However, the interest rate that changes along with the change of money supply cannot be the pure interest rate. A grain sowed into the soil can produce more grains a year later. How can the growth rate of this grain be affected by the increase or decrease of money supply? As mentioned in Lecture 18, the pure interest rate excluding inflation and risk (transaction cost) is the rate of return on investment that is objectively determined by the production capacity or efficiency in an economy, and cannot be changed by the monetary policy. As for the interest rate in reality, it does fluctuate under the influence of the money supply and demand, which actually reflects the change in the understanding of people about the pure interest rate and the factors of inflation and risk. The Fed interferes with the interest rate in the federal funds market by open market operation, which in fact cannot change the pure interest rate, but only makes the interest rate in the market no longer reflect the pure interest rate correctly, thus actually interfering with the understanding about the pure interest rate, which implies a rise in the information cost.</p>
<p>Although the interest rate in reality does have some relationship with the money supply, the regulation on it will interfere with the understanding about the pure interest rate, which is the same mistake as creating inflation to interfere with the understanding of people about the real price, and will also cause economic fluctuation or business cycle. The most typical example is the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US in 2008. Greenspan frequently changed the interest rate during his reign, making it sometimes rise and sometimes fall just like waves, causing economic entities sometimes to expand and sometimes to shrink their consumption and investment (production), which had nothing to do with the changes in real economy. Although the frequent fluctuation in interest rate was not the main cause of the financial crisis in 2008, it was sure to be a big &#x201C;accomplice&#x201D;.</p>
<p>How about directly regulating the money supply? The second difficulty is precisely that the monetary authority often does not know what the quantity of money (money supply) is! According to Fisher equation, the effective money supply is to multiply the quantity of paper money by the velocity of circulation. According to money multiplier, paper money is only M0, and most of money supply comes from deposit money created by commercial banks. However, $\frac{1}{R}$ is only a theoretical maximum of money multiplier instead of an effective value in reality.</p>
<p>Firstly, because the legal deposit reserves must be turned over to the central bank, commercial banks have to keep a certain amount of deposit reserves called &#x201C;excess reserves&#x201D; to meet the withdrawal of depositors. The amount of excess reserves varies for different banks, but it is sure to increase the effective DRR, leading to a decrease in money multiplier, and also a decrease in the quantity of deposit money.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the numerical example of money multiplier in Section 9, it is obvious that in the process of creation of deposit money by commercial banks&#x2019; operations of deposit and loan, depositors cannot withdraw cash. If a depositor withdraws part of cash, the money will leave the banking system and not continue to participate in the creation of deposit money, which also leads to a decrease in the quantity of deposit money. It is called &#x201C;leakage&#x201D; that refers to the withdrawal of cash that causes money to leak out of the banking system, resulting in a decline in the ability of commercial banks to create deposit money.</p>
<p>Thirdly, commercial banks can only create deposit money through the continuous operations of deposit and loan. If the operations are generally interrupted, the money multiplier will become invalid, resulting in a sudden sharp drop in deposit money.</p>
<p>Why do banks not engage in loan business? Generally, banks are sure to lend out the deposits to make money, but in some extreme cases, banks will be reluctant to lend. The most typical extreme case is when the economy is in recession, people are very pessimistic about the future. Consumers dare not borrow to spend, so consumer credit declines. Firms are unwilling to invest in production, so do not borrow money from banks. Banks neither believe that the investment of firms can be successful, so even if they apply for loans, banks are afraid that the loans will become bad loans and refuse to lend. It did happen in the financial crisis of the US in 2008. In order to stimulate economic growth with an expansionary monetary policy, the Fed had cut the federal fund interest rate to 0, but the loan rate of commercial banks was still above 5%. Obviously, most of the rate is risk premium, reflecting a rise in the risk of business failure, so the (loan) interest rate could not fall to 0.</p>
<p>There is a concept of &#x201C;Liquidity Trap&#x201D; invented by Keynes, which means that no matter how low the interest rate is during an economic depression, people will not increase the demand for money, leading to the failure of monetary policy. However, his explanation is wrong. The correct explanation should be as followed. Firstly, poor economic performance implies higher risk, and the part of risk premium in the interest rate will rise, so it is impossible for the loan rate to drop to 0. Secondly, the increase in risk also leads to banks&#x2019; reluctance to lend, which will interrupt their normal loan business and cause money multiplier to fail, so the quantity of deposit money decreases sharply. Even if the central bank injects a large amount of monetary base into the economy, it accounts for only a very small proportion of the money supply, so several times or even more of increase in monetary base may not make up for the decrease in deposit money and the total money supply has not increased. Thirdly, even if the total money supply has increased, because people are extremely pessimistic about the future and dare not consume or invest, the more money just lies in warehouses and does not circulate in the economy<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> , so the effective money supply has actually decreased.</p>
<p>As an international currency, the US dollar brings about a bigger problem that the money released by the Fed can flow out of the US, which is leakage in broad sense. The withdrawal of cash causes money to leak out of the banking system, which is leakage in narrow sense. If there is leakage in broad sense, the US dollars flowing out of the US cannot be effective money supply. During the financial crisis in 2008, people had no confidence in the economic prospect of the US, but had greater confidence in other countries (such as the emerging markets), so they invested the US dollars released by the Fed in the markets of other countries. As a result, even if the Fed had carried out QE many times, the inflation rate in the US did not, but it had caused serious inflation in other countries.</p>
<p>US dollars that flew into other countries would cause the central banks of other countries to passively issue more money. Take China as an example, foreigners who want to invest in China should first exchange US dollars for RMB in the foreign exchange market, which means they sell out US dollars and buy in RMB. It will lead to an oversupply of US dollars, so the exchange rate has to change to eliminate the disequilibrium supply and demand. It is, of course, the depreciation of US dollars and the appreciation of RMB. In order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of RMB, China&#x2019;s central bank will sell out RMB in the foreign exchange market to absorb excessive US dollars, thus passively issuing more RMB, which is called &#x201C;Position for Foreign Exchange Purchase&#x201D;. Foreigners use the RMB exchanged from the foreign exchange market in consumption and investment in China&#x2019;s domestic market, causing an increase in the quantity of RMB or inflation in China.</p>
<p>The global inflation during the financial crisis in 2008 was mainly caused by the QE of the Fed. The purpose of the Fed is to create domestic inflation, but the pessimistic expectation of the US economy caused the more issuance of US dollars by the Fed not to stay in the US to effectively increase the domestic money supply, but leak out of the US to other countries, thus increasing the money supply of other countries. There had happened political instability and regime change in many Arab countries (the so-called &#x201C;Arab Spring&#x201D;), the source of which actually the QE of the US. Take Egypt as an example. Why did the Egyptians overthrow Mubarak? Do they really want democracy and anti-dictatorship? Don&#x2019;t be naive! Mubarak had ruled Egypt for more than 30 years. If Egyptians really hated his autocratic rule, should not they have overthrown him long ago? The truth is: there was serious inflation in Egypt during that period. There had been extreme disparity between the rich and the poor in the Middle East countries. The governments relied on generous welfare to appease the poor. However, the QE of the Fed caused serious inflation (with the inflation rate of over 20%) suddenly, and welfare payments were often fixed and would not immediately be adjust along with inflation. In fact, people with fixed incomes are those who suffer the most from inflation. It is precisely why the poor could not survive anymore and rise up.</p>
<p>The inflation in China also became serious during that period, but was much lighter than other countries, which was attributed to the strong growth of China&#x2019;s real economy. Although the money supply had increased passively, the real economy had also increased, and some of the increased money was absorbed by the growth of the real economy, so as to keep the inflation rate below 10%.</p>
<p>In a word, although the central bank can directly control the monetary base and indirectly control the deposit money created by commercial banks through the legal DRR, the effective quantity of money in the economy is also affected by many factors beyond the control of it. There is still the second difficulty: how to know the effective quantity of money (money supply) in a country? The monetary base issued by the central bank is only a small part of money supply, and the main part of it is deposit money created by commercial banks that is also affected by many factors. If it is an international currency (like US dollar), there is even the possibility of leaking out of the country.</p>
<p>From the next section on, the best monetary system that can solve the two major difficulties of monetary policy will be introduced.</p>

<sup>1</sup>. In 2016, there was &#x201C;negative interest rate&#x201D; in Japan, which meant those saved money in banks could not have positive interest but had to pay interest to banks. The Japanese government wanted to &#x201C;force&#x201D; people not to save money, but to spend money on consumption or investment. However, after the implementation of this policy, the sales volume of household safes had increased greatly, which implied that people only transferred the money from the warehouses of banks to safes at home, and still refused to spend, so the money leaving the banking system had not circulated in the economy.<a href="#reffn_1" title="Jump back to footnote [1] in the text."> &#x21A9;</a>
