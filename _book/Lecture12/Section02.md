# Section 2: The Changeable Rent

Rent is amazing in that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes even zero! 

Take the numerical example in previous section as an example again, but suppose the options are about how to use a piece of land, as the Table 12-2 shows.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Agricultural Land|100|300|-200|
|B：Industrial Land|200|300|-100|
|C：Residential Land|300|200|100|

Table 12-2
</div>

Option A is to use the land to grow crops, and the income is 100. And option B is to use the land to build factories, and the income is 200. And option C is to use the land to build houses, and the income is 300. The respective cost and rent of these three options are also the same as those in Table 12-1 of previous section.

However, such division of options is rather rough. Option A is to use the land to grow crops, but what on earth is grown, wheat or rice? If it is rice, what is precisely the variety? Is fertilizer used? If yes, how much is used? Is one-harvest or two-harvest per year? In other words, there are actually countless sub-options in option A. It is the same for option B. Option B is to use the land to build a factory, but what kind of factory on earth is built? What is the plot ratio? Is it a bungalow or a building? How many floors? Is the factory of textiles, toys, steel, cars or software programs? It is the same for option C. Option C is to use the land to build a house, but what kind of house on earth is built? Is it a villa or an apartment? What is the plot ratio? How many floors? Is the building with or without elevators? How many households are there per floor? Is a household with one-hall-two-room or two-hall-three-room? Is the house with or without decoration?

As the option is subdivided, the rent will change. Suppose the option C is divided into two sub-options: villa and apartment, the above numerical example will become like this:

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Agricultural Land|100|300|-200|
|B：Industrial Land|200|300|-100|
|C1：Residential Land-Villa|250|300|-50|
|C2：Residential Land-Apartment|300|200|50|

<div align="center">
Table 12-3
</div>

As shown in Table 12-3, the rent of the optimum falls to 50 from the original 100 simply because the option C is subdivided. Attention: The optimum of C2 here is exactly the same as the previous optimum of C. The option C previously describes building an apartment on the land roughly as “residential land”, while the option C2 now more specifically describes it as “apartment”. And as the description becomes more specific, it can be seen that there is the option C1 of villa between B and C2. Thus, if the option C is subdivided, the suboptimum is no longer option B, but C1, so now it is the income of C1 instead of B becomes the cost of the optimum of C2. Since the income of C1 is higher than that of B, the cost of the optimum of C2 rises and the rent falls.

If the option C is further subdivided, until there are countless options within it, and then they are sorted by their incomes, the above numerical examples will become like this:

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Agricultural Land|100|300|-200|
|B：Industrial Land|200|300|-100|
|C<sub>1</sub>：Residential Land-Villa|250|300|-50|
|……||||
|C<sub>n-1</sub>|299.99999…|300|-0.0000…1|
|C<sub>n</sub>|300|299.99999…|0.0000…1|

（Note：n is infinity）

Table 12-4
</div>

The optimum of Cn can be described in detail as a 10-storied apartment with elevators, two households per floor, each household with two-hall-three-room, with refined decoration ... And Then a suboptimum of Cn-1 can be always found, which is almost exactly the same as Cn except for a slight difference (such as a slight difference in decoration or in orientation), so the income of it is also only a little difference (299.99999 ..., with an infinite number of 9) from that of Cn’s (300). With the option of C subdivided infinitely, the income of Cn-1 is the cost of Cn, which is also infinitely close to the income of Cn, and the rent is infinitely close to 0 from the direction of the positive number axis. By contrast, the rent of Cn-1 is infinitely close to 0 from the direction of the negative number axis.

There is another opposite direction for dealing with the options of how to use the land. Instead of infinite subdivision，the most rough division is to divide it into only two options like this:

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Use|0|300|-300|
|B：Not Use|300|0|300|

Table 12-5

If the land is left unused, the income will naturally be 0, so the cost of using it (specifically, building a 10-storied apartment on the land) will be also 0, and all the income will be rent.

Look back at the statement at the very beginning of this section: Rent is amazing in that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes even zero! The option is in fact always the same one which is objective and has never changed. What has changed is how to observe the option and to what degree the option is subdivided.

It is logically similar that if observed from the galaxy, the earth is a particle which means it is a body only with mass and without volume. However, if observed much more closely, like from the solar system, the earth can no longer be regarded as a particle without volume, but as a blue planet. Then if observed within the atmosphere of the earth, it is a combination of mud, rock, water and air. At last, if observed the most closely with a microscope, the earth is a compound of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and other atoms. It is always the same earth which is objective has never changed. What has changed is how closely to observe it.

Why are there different observations about the options? Because different problems need to be observed differently, just as different physics problems involving the earth need to be observed from different distances. For example, for the government, when it plans the use of a piece of land, it only needs to roughly divide the options into agricultural land, industrial land and residential land, and choose the option that can bring the highest rent to the society. If the land is planned to be used for building houses, the government will auction the land for residential use. The developers who come to bid will choose the option of villa or apartment depending on which can bring the highest rent. When the developers have bought the land and start construction, they will subdivide the options most specifically. Suppose they choose to build an apartment, they need to choose among all these options: what is the plot ratio? How many floors? Is the apartment with or without elevators? How many households are there per floor? Is a household with one-hall-two-room or two-hall-three-room? Is the house with or without decoration? ...... It is subject to which can bring the highest rent.

As mentioned before, self-interested human will choose the option with maximal rent. It can be seen from the numerical example that although the rent varies from large to small or even to zero along with the options being more and more sub-divided, no matter how the rent changes, the optimum of rent maximization is always the same one, and the relevant rent is always non-negative. In fact, only the rent of the optimum is non-negative. In other words, people do not need to calculate the exact value of the rent, but only need to know whether it is negative. If the rent of an option is negative, it must not be the optimum. It is also why rent maximization (non-negative rent) is often a better angle than income maximization or cost minimization. In reality, there is constraint of information cost, and the formation cost of judging whether the rent is non-negative is usually the least.

Let us review the two extreme situations: one is the most infinite subdivision of options, and the other is the roughest division that there are only two options of “use” and “not use”.

In the former case, the rent of the optimum is 0 and the cost is equal to the income. In other words, income is essentially cost. As mentioned in the previous lecture, the (opportunity) cost in economics is not expenditure used in daily life, but income which is the income of the sub-optimum given up rather than that of the optimum. However, it can be concluded from the above analysis that when the options are infinitely subdivided, the cost of the optimum is the income of itself.

In the latter case, the cost is 0 and the rent is equal to the income. In other words, income is essentially rent.

Deduced from these two extremes, when it is normal situation, rent is essentially cost. All income is cost, only part of it is the cost of the options observed, and part of it is the cost of the options not observed. In order to distinguish the options observed and not observed, the former is directly called “cost” and the latter is called “rent”, but in essence they are both costs. Thus, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost. It is a very important statement, because it is determined by self-interest and competition. And the implication of it is the “Zero-Profit Theorem” that will be introduced later.
