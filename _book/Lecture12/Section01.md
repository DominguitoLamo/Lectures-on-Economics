# Section 1: From Income and Cost to Rent

In the previous lecture, when explaining the concept of cost, there was a numerical example which is shown here in Table 12-1 with an additional column of “rent” calculated by subtracting (opportunity) cost from income.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A|100|300|-200|
|B|200|300|-100|
|C|300|200|100|

Rent of the third column in Table 12-1 is often called “economic profit” by MSE and distinguished from accounting profit which is calculated by subtracting accounting cost from income, just as opportunity cost introduced in the previous lecture distinguished from accounting cost (historical cost). The concept of cost in economics must refer to opportunity cost, so the word “opportunity” need not be mentioned in economics. Similarly, the concept of profit in economics must refer to economic profit, so the word “economic” does not need to be mentioned in economics. However, it is not very accurate for MSE to use “profit” to refer to the difference between income and cost. It is much more accurate to use “rent”. And the term of “profit” should be used to refer to another concept different from rent or profit in MSE, which will be discussed in the last section of this lecture.

Look back at the numerical example in Table 12-1. Firstly, for the income of the first column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, C will be chosen because it is the option with highest income. Secondly, for the cost of the second column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, again C will be chosen because it is the option with least cost. Finally, for the rent of the third column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, C will be still chosen because it is the option with highest rent. In other words, income maximization, cost minimization and rent maximization are all the same.

Under different circumstances, sometimes the information about the income of various options is easily available, while sometimes it is the information about cost, or sometimes it is that about rent. Therefore, these three different angles can be respectively adopted according to specific circumstances. In addition, different economists may be good at analysis from different angles. For example, Ronald Harry Coase (1910-2013) is especially good at analysis from the perspective of cost, while Steven Cheung likes the perspective of rent. As will be explained in the later lecture on the “Interest Theory”, wealth is the sum of the discounted values of future income, so under a certain discount rate (interest rate), income maximization is same as wealth maximization. In other words, with interest taken into account, wealth maximization or income maximization is the most common angle to analyze different options for investment.
