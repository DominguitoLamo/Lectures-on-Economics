<p>In the previous section, the concept of margin has been introduced from the perspective of mathematics. However, margin is an economic instead of mathematical concept, or else it should not be called &#x201C;margin&#x201D; but &#x201C;derivative&#x201D;. Margin is still significantly different from derivative in that there is requirement of &#x201C;continuously differentiability&#x201D; for derivative. As the example of the weight of people in a room in the previous section, that a person walks in is an incremental change of a discrete instead of a continuous variable because a person cannot be split into two halves, let alone into infinite numbers of infinitesimal persons. Strictly speaking, a discrete variable can not be taken the derivative. However, that is the requirement of mathematics, not economics which is not so demanding. As long as there is incremental change, no matter it is discrete or continuous, it is a margin.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Lecture 3, the postulate of self-interest cannot be directly applied to explain human&#x2019;s behaviors, but should be along with different constraints. If the constraints do not change, neither will human change his behavior, nor will the postulate of self-interest be meaningful. Economics is applied to predict that human will change his behavior according to both the postulate of self-interest and the change of constraints. By investigating whether human really change his behavior as predicted, economics including the postulate of self-interest is tested.</p>
<p>Self-interest is a postulate about the motivation of human&#x2019;s behaviors, and is unobservable intention. However, the change of constraints and human&#x2019;s behaviors are both observable facts. The postulate of self-interest and the change of constrains constitute the economic explanations which are tested by the change of human&#x2019;s behaviors. Therefore, if there is no change, there will be neither explanations nor tests. And change is margin! Difference is the same as change, which is also margin: that the same person changes his behaviors along with the change of constraints is logically similar to that different persons have different behaviors under different constraints. </p>
<p>Review the concept of margin from the perspective of mathematics introduced in previous section: MR or MC is the change of total revenue or cost due to the rise of Q. Similarly, from the perspective of economics, the change of human&#x2019;s behaviors is due to the change of constraints. This is the economic implication of marginal analysis, which can include all kinds of human&#x2019;s behaviors and constraints, and that is why marginal analysis is so important in economics.</p>
<p>Next, we will introduce various applications of marginal analysis in detail.
Firstly, the basic application of marginal analysis is to explain phenomena or behaviors by using the postulate of self-interest without falling into the trap of tautology.</p>
<p>For example, there is a question as homework I designed: a girl claims that she often offers her seat to others on the bus, so she is not self-interested or rational. One of the replies is, &#x201C;The benefit of psychological comfort from offering her seat on the bus outweighs the loss from the tiredness of standing, so she chooses to offer her seat. By contrast, those who do not offer their seats think the benefit of psychological comfort is too little for them to outweigh the loss of standing.&#x201D; Is the reply right? How should you refute the girl?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is: the reply seems reasonable, but in fact it directly uses the postulate of self-interest to explain the girl&#x2019;s behavior, which is a tautology. In order to avoid making the mistake of tautology, the change of constraint must be added, which means marginal analysis must be applied. But how? The girl says that she offers her seat &#x201C;often&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;always&#x201D;. Why does she sometimes offer her seat but sometimes not? Is she sometimes self-interested or rational and sometimes not? It is obviously ridiculous. This is the best refute to the girl.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not the purpose of economics to refute the girl, but to explain her behavior scientifically. Sometimes she offers her seat and sometimes not, not because she is sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because the constraints she faces at different times are different, which leads to different behaviors. The girl will offer her seat on the short-distance bus, but how about on the long-distance train? Once she has offered her seat, she will have to stand for hours or even a whole day. Will she still choose to offer her seat? The girl will offer her seat to the old, children and pregnant women, but how about those who are strong and young? Will she still choose to offer her seat to them?</p>
<p>The above cases are not chosen randomly, but purposefully. The former case is about the change in the constraint of increasing cost, while the latter case is about the change in the constraint of decreasing income (the non-monetary income of psychological comfort). It is clear that with the change of constraints, the girl&#x2019;s behaviors have also changed, and the direction of the change is in line with the postulate self-interest, which means when the cost of offering her seat increases or the income decreases, she tends not to do so. Thus, her own behaviors have definitely refuted her claim that she is not self-interested or rational.</p>
<p>In a word, it is the basic application of marginal analysis: to add the change of constraint to the postulate, concepts or theories with the nature of tautology, so that the explanations using them become refutable and scientific.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are three extended application of marginal analysis.</p>
<p>(1) Marginal analysis can be used to screen the key constraints.
There are thousands of constraints in reality, but it is impossible for all of them to have critical impacts on the phenomena or behaviors to be explained. One of the important applications of marginal analysis is to help to screen the false constraints that seem to have impacts.</p>
<p>Specifically, observe whether there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or whether there is the same behavior under different constraints. If the constraint remains unchanged, neither should the relevant behavior change. On the contrary, the behavior will change along with the change of constraint. Therefore, if there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or if there is the same behavior under different constraints, that the relevant constraints may be redundant and not the key ones.</p>
<p>For example, since 2012, China has implemented the policy of free passage of cars with less than seven seats on expressways during the National Day. As a result, there has been serious traffic jam on expressways during the National Day. Different parties have explained this phenomenon differently. Economics is a science, and should avoid the disturbance of subjective feelings and interests to judge these explanations from an objective perspective. It is precisely where marginal analysis is very useful.</p>
<p>Some argue that the traffic jam on expressways is not due to the policy of free passage, but because there are always more cars using expressways during the National Day holiday than usual. In other words, in this explanation, the National Day holiday is regarded as the key constraint which causes traffic jam. However, there was the National Day holiday not only since 2012, which means this constraint has not changed at all. How can it cause the change in the phenomenon that traffic jam was significantly more serious than that in previous years? Thus, it has refuted this explanation of the National Day holiday as the key constraint.</p>
<p>Some others argue that it may be because the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day in 2012 were linked together, resulting in more traffic than previous years. In this explanation, the long holidays are still regarded as the key constraint, but just the 8-day long holiday of 2012 is longer than before (7 days). However, with marginal analysis, this explanation is again easily refuted. If traffic jam was really caused by the longest holiday in history, this constraint is exactly the same for expressway and national highway. According to marginal analysis, if the constraint is the same, the phenomenon or behavior should be the same, which here means there should the same traffic jams on national highways as on expressways. However, there was not such news of serious traffic jams in national highways.</p>
<p>(2) In economics, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation, so marginal analysis is more useful.</p>
<p>Different from natural science, it is almost impossible to obtain the total magnitude of a social phenomenon in social science. Fortunately, with marginal analysis, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation.
Let us continue to take the free policy on expressways during the National Day since 2010 as an example. According to marginal analysis, we can infer that the free policy is more likely to cause those who originally planned to go out to change from using national highways to expressways than to cause those who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. When one changes from not going out to going out, the increase in marginal cost will not only include the toll of expressways, but also the expense on oil, food, housing and so on. However, if one has already planned to go out, the increase in marginal cost is only the difference of toll between national highways and expressways, which is actually negative with the free policy. Therefore, the free policy will cause all who have planned to go out to change from using national highways to using expressways, but just cause some who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. We do not need to investigate how much precisely the total cost of going out is, but just need to logically identify the change in marginal cost.</p>
<p>(3) Equal marginal principle is a useful application of marginal analysis.
Equal marginal principle which will be discussed in the later lecture of &#x201C;Market Structure: Price-Searching&#x201D; is a very useful application of marginal analysis. It can be proved by mathematics that in order to achieve optimum, all relevant factors should be equal on the margin. For example, for producers, in order to achieve so-called profit maximization (strictly speaking, rent maximization), he should try to equalize the marginal revenue and marginal cost of the production (i.e. MR=MC), which is also called production equilibrium.</p>
<p>It is a more technical application of marginal analysis, and is widely used in mathematical models. However, even without mathematics, it can be also applied in economics. It can be inferred from equal marginal principle that it is optimal if this principle is satisfied, while it is not optimal if this principle is not satisfied.</p>
<p>Let us continue to take the free policy on expressways as an example. This free policy seems to be beneficial to people. However, the cost of expressways will not disappear, so the question of how to collect enough money to cover the cost remains. If there is toll for passage of expressways, the cost is covered by those who use expressways. By contrast, if it is free to use expressways, governments need to input fiscal money to cover the cost through tax collection. In the former case, those who use expressways pay the cost, so it is clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal. By contrast, in the latter case, those who use expressways do not pay, but all tax-payers, no matter whether they have used expressways or not, pay the cost by paying taxes. It is not clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal, because the users and payers are not the same people.</p>
<p>It is normally thought that the former case is fair while the latter case is unfair. However, economics forbids value judgment. Seen from economics, in the former case, it is easier to achieve the optimum that marginal income is equal to marginal cost, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is lower. By contrast, in the latter case, it is difficult to achieve this optimum, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is higher. Because the users and payers are not the same, the relationship between cost and income is not clear, which causes the so-called &#x201C;waste&#x201D; and is harmful to the interest of the whole society by using more social wealth or income to pay higher transaction cost.</p>
<p>It is also why there is higher transaction cost for indirect payment than direct payment. It is difficult for a consumer to know whether his consumption has reached the optimum where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, because the cost paid by him is not directly related to the revenue from his consumption. In other words, the information cost (a kind of transaction cost) about the optimal consumption is higher. In particular, consumers misunderstand that there is no cost when there is free policy, but in fact they have paid the cost indirectly by paying taxes, so they will consume too much, which means they consume more than the optimum determined by equal marginal principle, and the part of actual consumption exceeding the optimum is a waste with the cost greater than revenue.</p>
<p>Caution: even when there is no free policy implemented by government, the market will sometimes voluntarily chooses to use indirect payment, because under some constraint, it is possible that although the transaction cost of indirect payment is relatively higher, there is some other benefit which can cover the transaction cost, and indirect payment is optimal as a whole.</p>
<p>As for the example of free policy on expressways, those without cars are often poorer, while those with cars are often richer. It seems extremely unfair to pay the cost of expressways with taxes instead of collecting tolls, because it is equivalent to force the poor who have no cars and do not use expressways but have to pay taxes for expressways to subsidize the rich. However, the key point is those that infringe PPRs are evil policies or laws, no matter whether they infringe the PPRs of the rich or the poor. Therefore, the free policy on expressways is an evil policy not because it &#x201C;robs&#x201D; the poor to help the rich, but because it &#x201C;robs&#x201D; those who do not use expressways no matter they are poor or rich. No economic theory agrees with &#x201C;rob the rich to give the poor&#x201D;.</p>
