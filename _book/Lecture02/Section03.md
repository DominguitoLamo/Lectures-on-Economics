# Section 3: Why Do We Need to Study Economics?

Why do we need to study Economics? Many readers may believe that those individuals major in economics are easier to find good jobs (and jobs with high incomes), or learn to know how to earn money. In reality, those whose careers are economic-related do have higher incomes, but they are not the richest ones while the richest ones may not be those major in economics or even have never learned economics.

As an economics teacher, I hope that the readers would master the way of thinking like an economist as most are not, and will not be economists. They do not need to be economists, but they need to think like economists. 

As mentioned above, economics is a science, analyzing problems objectively just like natural science. However, natural science only teaches us how to analyze problems about the matter, while economics teaches us how to analyze the problems about human. To learn to think like an economist is to learn to analyze problems objectively, ruling out emotions like anger, as this should be economics most benefit to ordinary people.

Besides, some economists distort economics analysis for their interests and try to mislead the public and governments to benefit themselves. Therefore, if one has learned economics, he will not be fooled by such economists. Mrs. Robinson, a famous British female economist, once said: “I study economics in order to avoid being deceived by economists.” That is also my Motto.
