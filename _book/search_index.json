1: Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 1: Introduction\nBefore the study of economics, it is necessary to remind readers that never believe the ordinary textbooks of economics without thinking.\nIn general, textbooks are the truth. However, it is not the case for economics. There are many mistakes in the books of economics.\nWhy? Because economics is too young.\nLet me introduce the history of Economics. A question: when was USA independent? The answer: in 1776. It is the same year that a British named Adam Smith (1723-1790) published his book “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,” which marked the birth of economics. So Adam Smith is the founder of economics. Students and the researchers of economics, including you and me, are his disciples.\nSo you can see how young economics is, just like the USA that is only 200 years old. It is no wonder that there are lots of mistakes in economics. \nNatural science, such as physics, is regarded as truth. However, don't forget that Aristotle started to study it thousands of years ago. It has been developing for thousands of years. There had also been many mistakes in physics. For example, physicists believed that the falling speed of an object was correlating with its mass, which is totally wrong. The falling rate of a stone is faster than the plume’s just because the air friction interferes in. Another example is astronomy. How long had erroneous Geocentric been dominant in astronomy?\nSo it is not a surprise that there are many mistakes in economics because it is only 200 years old. It is a surprise that we entirely believe economics textbooks without thinking. In fact, many authors of economics textbooks do not take all that they write in books for granted. However, textbooks are not academic work, so it is better to follow the majority. Nevertheless, truth is often in the hand of the minority.\nHowever, I decided to write a textbook on economics which does not follow the majority. I will select only the correct contents from ordinary textbooks of economics, criticize the mistakes and add something new and correct. Therefore, this book looks somewhat different from the usual textbooks of economics.\nSomeone would doubt whether the truth is subject to my judgment. How can we know the truth objectively? We need an assistant: Methodology of Science (MS) or Philosophy of Science which provides an objective analysis of whether a subject is a science. It applies not only for economics but also for all kinds of sciences. The scholars of MS establish the rules of science form the practice of natural science. So it makes one significant distinction between ordinary textbooks and this book that there are many introductions of MS in this book. In my opinion, the best way to master MS for those who are not the students of philosophy or logics is to learn economics.\nBesides, this book is suitable for both students major in economics and amateurs. There is some math in this book for the economics students to study, while for beginners, math is not essential, though understanding it does help to understand economics better. But you do not need to be anxious if you cannot understand the math in this book, because the application of economics does not rely on math.\nThis textbook inherits the academic discipline from “Economics Explanation” by Steven N.G Cheung. The references of traditional economics textbook are mainly from “Theory of Price and Application” written by Cheung’s teacher Jack Hirshleifer (1925-2005). Cheung wrote a preface “The Experience of Learning -- Preface for My Teacher’s Textbook” for its Chinese version translated by Zhou Yan and me. In the preface, He suggested that students read the “Theory of Price and Application” with critical thinking instead of belief. It is more important to raise questions and discuss with classmates or teachers. That is the real study!\nI would like to share these words with all the readers of this book as an encouragement!\n\f\n"},"Lecture02/":{"url":"Lecture02/","title":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science\nEconomics is a social science, which is the subject nature of it. However, what does it mean?

Science is an activity of human intelligence. It starts from one or several postulates or axioms from which a set of theories and inferences are established as a system. Besides, all the conclusions of this theoretical system must be tested by fact.\nThis definition of “Science” can be divided into three stages also known as “Trilogy of Science”.\nThe first stage is postulates and axioms, which is the starting point of science. It does not need proof; neither needs to be true; it just needs to be accepted without any doubts. Sceptics doubt everything including those as a starting point. But what can be done without a starting point?\nThe second stage is a logical deduction. Mathematics as a tool assisting logical deduction may be useful for science. However, Math is not science itself, but a useful tool for the second stage of science.\nThe third stage is the fact test, which makes the distinction between science and math: there are only the previous two stages in math (Geometry is a typical instance). Without this third stage, math is not science. Since the first stage of science needs no proof and does not allow any doubts, it seems very arbitrary and even unreasonable. Then how can be it sure to be OK? That is why science needs the support of fact in the third stage.\nIt is the third stage that distinguishes science from math. Therefore, an essential feature of science is not provability, but refutability. That is, fact can refute it2.\nThere is a serious and rather common misunderstanding about science that should be clarified. The public usually presumes that science is equivalent to truth. This is a misconception as they are totally different. A statement with refutability is scientific; otherwise, it is non-scientific. The false is the refuted but the truth is not the unrefuted. Therefore, it is not contradictory to say science is false and non-science is true.\nLet us consider this example of unscientific truth: a four-footed animal has four feet. It is impossible to find a fact to refute this statement, which means it is absolutely true. However, what is irrefutable is exactly unscientific. Think about it deeply; why is that the statement cannot be falsified or refuted? Because the former part of it just repeats the latter part. In other words, A is B, so B is A. Such un-scientific, but true statement is called tautology which means repetition. Human study science in order to discover new knowledge, but tautology does not add any new knowledge; instead, it only repeats what already established. That is why tautology is absolutely true but becomes unscientific.\nTautology is not the only case of irrefutable statements. There are also four kinds of unscientific statements: unreality, ambiguity, contradiction and unrestrained.\nThe statement of “God exists.” is unscientific; instead, it is associated more with religion. The question here is why so? This is because the concept of God is not a fact, and it cannot be tested by facts, which leads to irrefutability.\nSeen from another point of view, the concept “God” is ambiguous, which also leads to irrefutability. Superstition, which is somewhat similar to religion, tries to avoid being refuted with ambiguity. \nHere is a story: Three students go to take an important public examination. They meet a fortune-teller on the road, so ask him to predict their examination results. The fortune-teller just raises a finger and says nothing. \nPossible outcomes: If one of them passes the examination, that one-finger means one succeeds. If two of them pass, it means one of them fails. If all of them pass or do not pass, it means they as a group succeed or fail3. Whatever the result will be, the fortune-teller can redefine the ambiguous meaning of the one-finger to make sure he is always right. However, it is unscientific precisely because it is irrefutable.\nThe statement of “There is a black point on an all-white wall.” is also unscientific. With this contradiction, the conclusion of “The wall is a god” will be deducted. Is it only an omnipotent god who can be both black and white?\nIn a math class at middle schools, they teach that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, only a few know that it is also the way of testing science.\n If “A ⇒ B” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” instead of “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”should be used. \nBy analogy if “A ⇒ B and C” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” and “not (C) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. If “A ⇒ B, C, D…” is tested, because there are limitless propositions deduced from A, the test about A are endless, and become irrefutable. It is not easy to find a simple case to illustrate this situation of unrestrained, which will be pointed out when it occurs.\n“Scientific faults” are refutable statements and have been refuted by facts. For example; there are two conflicting theories of Heliocentric and Geocentric on the relationship between sun and earth.\nWhich of them is true? How to test them? Copernicus argued that if Heliocentric were true, then Venus would be waxing and waning like the moon, which is \"A ⇒ B\" where A is Heliocentric, and B is the Venus' phase. So the test condition for this statement is that if the Venus were not waxing and waning, Heliocentric would be false, which is \"not (A) ⇒ not (B)\". Heliocentric can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. On the other hand, Geocentric can also present its refutable condition: if the Venus were waxing and waning, Geocentric would be false, so it is scientific too. Afterwards, Galileo observed with a telescope, found that the Venus does be waxing and waning, which refuted Geocentric and supported Heliocentric. Then Geocentric is scientifically false because it has been reputed though it is reputable. By contrast, Heliocentric is not only refutable but also true, because the observation of Galileo does not refute it. \"Reputability\" is the characteristic of science, while \"Refuted\" is the end of false theories, which should not be confused with each other.\nThus human observes the reality, exact the laws out of facts, then make up science theories which can be used to explain what has happened and predict what will happen. If the explanations and predictions have not been refuted by facts, then theories can be accepted as true. But if they are refuted, the theories need to be revised, or even abandoned entirely.\nThe example of Heliocentric illustrates that the theories accepted as true are not true. More accurately speaking, they are just not refuted for now, which does not mean that they will never be refuted in the future, because they are always refutable in science. In fact, with the development of Astronomy, Heliocentric theory has been revised from the idea that all planets, including the Earth, move around the Sun from the centric orbits to the oval orbits. Now the heliocentric theory has been abandoned and replaced by the theory of cosmic expansion because the sun is no longer believed as the center of the Universe.\nLogics also deny that science or refutable theories can be absolutely true. For example, even human has seen thousands of white swans and find no one is black; still, they cannot conclude that there are no black ones in the world. The statement “all swans are white” can be accepted as true, but just for now.\nOf course, only scientifically true theories are desirable, because they can increase human’s knowledge and guide the practice. As mentioned above, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, human firstly tries to explain what has happened to construct theories, then with which predict what will happen by observing if the predictions come true, human test the theories again and again.\nIt seems rather abstract, so let us take examples to illustrate the above interpretation. In Physics, Newton’s laws explain or deduct the phenomenon of an apple falling on the ground. They are accepted as true because we never see an apple flying to the sky. Airplanes that can fly to the sky are invented, which does not violate but apply Newton’s laws. As long as the conditions required by Newton’s laws are satisfied, airplanes never fall from the sky, which proves the laws are true. \nSo, why is Economics scientific?\nEconomics is a set of systematic theories deduced from a postulate which is “human are all self-interested”, and an axiom which is the Law of Demand. Economics can be used to explain some phenomena that cannot be explained by Physics. For example, there is a $100 bill in a public place. Physics can explain why it is gone with the wind. However, it cannot explain why the bill is still gone without wind which only can be explained by economics.\nThe Theory of Supply and Demand (TSD) introduced in later lectures argues that the price will rise if the demand exceeds the supply, while the price will fall if the supply exceeds the demand. As long as the conditions required by the TSD are satisfied, it has never been refuted. If the government imposes price control, forbidding sellers to increase prices when the demand exceeds supply, it seems that the price does not rise, but it does in the other form, such as the time spent on queuing and the red pockets paid as bribe. The logic is similar to the fact of airplanes flying to the sky does not violate Newton’s laws. So, it just proves that the TSD is true again. \n\n\n1. This section introduces the key points of MS. Those who are interested in it should read such masterpieces as “The Logic of Scientific Discovery” (Karl Popper, 1902-1994) and “The Philosophy of Natural Science” (Carl G. Hempel, 1905-1997).  ↩\n\n\n2. Here \"Science\" is a narrow-sense concept. Some scholars call those subjects without refutability, such as Logics and Mathematics, as \"Formal Science\", while those with refutability as \"Empirical Science\". That concept of science is a broad-sense one. This book use “Science” in narrow-sense which is refutable, i.e. \"Empirical Science\". ↩\n\n\n3.

What is the difference? Physics studies matter, while economics studies human, which is the fundamental difference.\nWhy is it a fundamental difference? Because economists are human too! In other words, economists themselves are also the study objects. Chemistry is a natural science, of which the study object is a molecule, while the studiers are human. What happens if molecules study themselves? Since economists as studiers and their study objects are all human, it causes much trouble. \nFirstly, human has emotion, while science requires objective analysis where subjective emotion should be ruled out. It is easy for natural scientists with the matter as a study object to do so, while rather tricky for social scientists who themselves are also human to rule out their emotions. Economic issues often arouse social disputes with anger. Anger is precisely a kind of emotion which should be ruled out in the discussion of economic issues since economics is a science. Anger can never be used to discuss issues of physics; however, once issues are economical, it is difficult to rule out the emotion of anger! \nSecondly, the postulate of economics is the self-interest of human. Economists are, of course, self-interested too, which cause a severe problem: some economists do not objectively analyze issues with economic theories, but distort their analysis intentionally or unintentionally and make the conclusions beneficial to them. For example, there are many debates on the issue of property prices in China. Different economists have very different opinions. No wonder the public doubt if economics is a science.\nThere is a joke that ten economists would have eleven opinions on the same economic issue. There are three reasons for this weird phenomenon:\n(1) As mentioned in the previous lecture, there are still so many mistakes in economics nowadays. Only wrong conclusions can be made by analysis with wrong theories.\n(2) Economics is rather simple but very difficult to apply. So there is a great distinction between a master and a lame duck. A skillful woodcarver can make a masterpiece out of wood while a clumsy one cannot make anything. Similarly, the second-rate or unqualified economists can only make the wrong conclusion even with correct economic theories.\n(3) It may be the most key reason. As mentioned above, the self-interested economists distort their analysis to make the conclusions most beneficial to them. It is neither because the theories are wrong, nor because they do not understand how to use the theories correctly, but because they need these conclusions beneficial to them.\nNatural science such as physics has the advantage that it can avoid the distortions by self-interest and emotion of human. However, this kind of distortion did occur in the history of the developments of natural science. It may be not well-known that Newton was not a good guy. Historians believe that the fight for the invention of calculus between Newton and Leibniz had postponed the development of mathematics in the UK by at least a century. Besides, he was so narrow-minded that he severely squeezed Hooker, another famous physicist, out.\nThere is a real story in “The Passions of the Mind”, a biography of Freud. When Freud began his career as a psychiatrist, in medicine, there was a wrong thought and people believed that only females would suffer from hysteria because they thought psychosis was only for those with weak willing. Due to this discrimination for female, psychiatrists at that time, never thought about the possibility of male patients. \nHowever, Freud found some cases of male patients of hysteria in the clinic. Napoleon was a patient of hysteria, which showed that hysteria had nothing to do with a weak will and that even males can get hysteria. Nevertheless, at that time, the prejudice for female was so strong that such ridiculous thought was prevalent even though medicine is natural science with the human body instead of a human being as its study object.\nFreud published his finding in an academic paper which caused criticisms and attack on him overwhelmingly. He did not take them seriously but was surprised and upset by the criticism of a massively respected elder in medicine whom he adored. He felt puzzled why the elder who is more experienced than him refused to admit that there were male patients of hysteria. \nDue to the intense criticisms, Freud lost his reputation and even job. Many years later, when the respected elder was dying, he called Freud to his bed and said: “In fact, no one in the world knows more clearly than I that you are right, because I am a male patient of hysteria myself.”\nThe respected elder was not ignorant. Precisely because he knew undoubtedly, he could not accept the truth. If one refuses to accept the truth because of ignorance, he cannot be educated. Nevertheless, if the truth is adverse to his benefits, it is in vain to try to persuade him by reasoning. There is a Chinese saying that a scholar cannot reason with a soldier. That is because the soldier does not intend to reason with him. It is the same for those who want to hide their selfish desires by disguising to reason.\nThus natural science with the matter as study object has the same problem as economics. However, natural science has the advantage that it can do controllable experiments in labs to test theories. Different persons have different interests, so it is usually not easy for natural science is manipulated by a few persons. While the lab of economics is the uncontrollable real world, so it is much easier for few economists to take advantage of the public’s ignorance and the emotion to distort the economic analysis and make conclusions beneficial to them at the expense of the reputation of all economists as a whole.\nThe public is confused to see different economists have such divergent opinions on the same issue hence doubt if economics is a science like physics. It is some economists instead of economics that should carry the blames.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: THE ECOLOGIST, THE ECONOMIST, AND THE STATISTICIAN1\nIn 1990 the ecologist and popular author Paul Ehrlich sent a check for $576.07 to the economist Julian L. Simon. It was a payoff on a bet made 10 years previously. Ehrlich, though not an economist, had made startling economic predictions in his 1968 best-seller The Population Bomb. Take, for example, his opening sentences: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.”\nEhrlich’s predictions utterly failed. Despite an “oil crisis” in mid-decade and again toward the end, overall the 1970s were a decade of remarkable economic growth. Yet the author continued to be highly acclaimed. In books, speeches, and articles that received worldwide attention, he prophesied that accessible supplies of many key minerals would be nearly depleted by 1985.\nMeanwhile the economist Julian L. Simon had been predicting just the reverse for the1970s and1980s: “continuing improvements in human well-being, and lower prices for raw materials. Simon challenged Ehrlich to back his contrary forecast with hard cash, and Ehrlich accepted the challenge. The result was a 1980 bet about whether the prices of five important metals – chrome, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten – would, after allowing for inflation, rise or fall by 1990. The economist let the ecologist choose specific commodities\". Once again, economist Simon was proved right and Ehrlich wrong. The 1980s were also a decade of prosperity, and raw materials prices generally fell. The ecologist had to pay off on the bet.\nEhrlich’s analytic error was to look only at the demand side, and specifically at a growing world population (more mouths to feed). Julian Simon, with his better economic understanding, also considered the supply side. More people mean more mouths, but also more hands and brains. Simon also took account of other favorable economic trends such as greater liberalization of national economies and increased international trade.\nSo the predictions of economic analysis were vindicated. Nevertheless, Paul Ehrlich continued to publish highly popular books forecasting, as mistakenly as before, environmental doom in the near future. Just as regularly, up to his death in 1998 Julian Simon was providing sound analysis and well-validated economic forecasts, culminating in his volume The Ultimate Resource (2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1998). But none of his books was best-sellers.\nWhat was going on here? An economic interpretation might be that these two authors were supplying different commodities. Julian Simon was supplying correct economic analysis. Paul Ehrlich was and is in a different business, somewhat comparable to horror-story writers such as Stephen King. Evidently, at least when it comes to selling books, the demand for horror stories far exceeds the demand for sound economic analysis. [ For a detailed history of the Ehrlich-Simon wager see John Tierney, “Betting the Planet,” New York Times Magazine, December 2, 1990.]\nA later exhaustive and careful study by the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg (The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001) has updated Simon’s results. Initially intending to refute Simon’s analysis, Lomborg found his research instead of confirming it. Despite the rising world population, per capita incomes have maintained their upward trend and real prices of essential resources have continued to fall.\nAs a rather strange sidelight, upon publishing these results, Lomborg became the target of personal attacks that reached an extraordinary level of intensity. At one of his public presentations, a cream pie was dumped on his face and clothing. He was even accused of “intellectual dishonesty” by a scientific body with official standing in Denmark. Ultimately, all the charges were conclusively refuted, and the improperly motivated proceeding against Lomborg was dismissed. (Which does not necessarily mean, of course, that all of Lomborg’s estimates and forecasts will ultimately prove to be correct.)\nOne possible lesson: sound economic analysis can sometimes be riskier than one might think2\n\nThe material above shows that Ehrlich was not an economist, and facts had refuted his analysis, but his books were still more popular than those by Simon as an economist. Why? Because the demand for Ehrlich’s book is the same as for horror fictions instead of correct economic analysis. Ehrlich kept writing books full of mistakes, not to provide correct economic analysis, but to attract readers as an alarmist. There are similar cases in China too. Who should carry the blames, economics, or some so-called economists?\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that when people enjoy themselves by reading horror fictions, they know that they are just fictions, it will not feel panic. Who would believe that the film of “2012” would become real, and be so horrified to sell out their properties or even commit suicide? But when some economists, with the name of a scientist, are engaged in faking horror fictions, the consequences will be severe. The public thought what they provide were correct economic analysis, but they only make alarmist remarks to earn money. If the government does believe them and implement economic policies according to the analysis of such economists, the consequence will be disastrous.\n\n\n1.
