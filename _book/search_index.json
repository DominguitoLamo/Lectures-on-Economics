1: Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 1: Introduction\nBefore the study of economics, it is necessary to remind readers that never believe the ordinary textbooks of economics without thinking.\nIn general, textbooks are the truth. However, it is not the case for economics. There are many mistakes in the books of economics.\nWhy? Because economics is too young.\nLet me introduce the history of Economics. A question: when was USA independent? The answer: in 1776. It is the same year that a British named Adam Smith (1723-1790) published his book “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,” which marked the birth of economics. So Adam Smith is the founder of economics. Students and the researchers of economics, including you and me, are his disciples.\nSo you can see how young economics is, just like the USA that is only 200 years old. It is no wonder that there are lots of mistakes in economics. \nNatural science, such as physics, is regarded as truth. However, don't forget that Aristotle started to study it thousands of years ago. It has been developing for thousands of years. There had also been many mistakes in physics. For example, physicists believed that the falling speed of an object was correlating with its mass, which is totally wrong. The falling rate of a stone is faster than the plume’s just because the air friction interferes in. Another example is astronomy. How long had erroneous Geocentric been dominant in astronomy?\nSo it is not a surprise that there are many mistakes in economics because it is only 200 years old. It is a surprise that we entirely believe economics textbooks without thinking. In fact, many authors of economics textbooks do not take all that they write in books for granted. However, textbooks are not academic work, so it is better to follow the majority. Nevertheless, truth is often in the hand of the minority.\nHowever, I decided to write a textbook on economics which does not follow the majority. I will select only the correct contents from ordinary textbooks of economics, criticize the mistakes and add something new and correct. Therefore, this book looks somewhat different from the usual textbooks of economics.\nSomeone would doubt whether the truth is subject to my judgment. How can we know the truth objectively? We need an assistant: Methodology of Science (MS) or Philosophy of Science which provides an objective analysis of whether a subject is a science. It applies not only for economics but also for all kinds of sciences. The scholars of MS establish the rules of science form the practice of natural science. So it makes one significant distinction between ordinary textbooks and this book that there are many introductions of MS in this book. In my opinion, the best way to master MS for those who are not the students of philosophy or logics is to learn economics.\nBesides, this book is suitable for both students major in economics and amateurs. There is some math in this book for the economics students to study, while for beginners, math is not essential, though understanding it does help to understand economics better. But you do not need to be anxious if you cannot understand the math in this book, because the application of economics does not rely on math.\nThis textbook inherits the academic discipline from “Economics Explanation” by Steven N.G Cheung. The references of traditional economics textbook are mainly from “Theory of Price and Application” written by Cheung’s teacher Jack Hirshleifer (1925-2005). Cheung wrote a preface “The Experience of Learning -- Preface for My Teacher’s Textbook” for its Chinese version translated by Zhou Yan and me. In the preface, He suggested that students read the “Theory of Price and Application” with critical thinking instead of belief. It is more important to raise questions and discuss with classmates or teachers. That is the real study!\nI would like to share these words with all the readers of this book as an encouragement!\n\f\n"},"Lecture02/":{"url":"Lecture02/","title":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science\nEconomics is a social science, which is the subject nature of it. However, what does it mean? This lecture will explain it with the methodologies of science.\n"},"Lecture02/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture02/Section01.html","title":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability","keywords":"","body":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability1\nEconomics is a science. Science is an activity of human intelligence. It starts from one or several postulates or axioms from which a set of theories and inferences are established as a system. Besides, all the conclusions of this theoretical system must be tested by fact.\nThis definition of “Science” can be divided into three stages also known as “Trilogy of Science”.\nThe first stage is postulates and axioms, which is the starting point of science. It does not need proof; neither needs to be true; it just needs to be accepted without any doubts. Sceptics doubt everything including those as a starting point. But what can be done without a starting point?\nThe second stage is a logical deduction. Mathematics as a tool assisting logical deduction may be useful for science. However, Math is not science itself, but a useful tool for the second stage of science.\nThe third stage is the fact test, which makes the distinction between science and math: there are only the previous two stages in math (Geometry is a typical instance). Without this third stage, math is not science. Since the first stage of science needs no proof and does not allow any doubts, it seems very arbitrary and even unreasonable. Then how can be it sure to be OK? That is why science needs the support of fact in the third stage.\nIt is the third stage that distinguishes science from math. Therefore, an essential feature of science is not provability, but refutability. That is, fact can refute it2.\nThere is a serious and rather common misunderstanding about science that should be clarified. The public usually presumes that science is equivalent to truth. This is a misconception as they are totally different. A statement with refutability is scientific; otherwise, it is non-scientific. The false is the refuted but the truth is not the unrefuted. Therefore, it is not contradictory to say science is false and non-science is true.\nLet us consider this example of unscientific truth: a four-footed animal has four feet. It is impossible to find a fact to refute this statement, which means it is absolutely true. However, what is irrefutable is exactly unscientific. Think about it deeply; why is that the statement cannot be falsified or refuted? Because the former part of it just repeats the latter part. In other words, A is B, so B is A. Such un-scientific, but true statement is called tautology which means repetition. Human study science in order to discover new knowledge, but tautology does not add any new knowledge; instead, it only repeats what already established. That is why tautology is absolutely true but becomes unscientific.\nTautology is not the only case of irrefutable statements. There are also four kinds of unscientific statements: unreality, ambiguity, contradiction and unrestrained.\nThe statement of “God exists.” is unscientific; instead, it is associated more with religion. The question here is why so? This is because the concept of God is not a fact, and it cannot be tested by facts, which leads to irrefutability.\nSeen from another point of view, the concept “God” is ambiguous, which also leads to irrefutability. Superstition, which is somewhat similar to religion, tries to avoid being refuted with ambiguity. \nHere is a story: Three students go to take an important public examination. They meet a fortune-teller on the road, so ask him to predict their examination results. The fortune-teller just raises a finger and says nothing. \nPossible outcomes: If one of them passes the examination, that one-finger means one succeeds. If two of them pass, it means one of them fails. If all of them pass or do not pass, it means they as a group succeed or fail3. Whatever the result will be, the fortune-teller can redefine the ambiguous meaning of the one-finger to make sure he is always right. However, it is unscientific precisely because it is irrefutable.\nThe statement of “There is a black point on an all-white wall.” is also unscientific. With this contradiction, the conclusion of “The wall is a god” will be deducted. Is it only an omnipotent god who can be both black and white?\nIn a math class at middle schools, they teach that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, only a few know that it is also the way of testing science.\n If “A ⇒ B” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” instead of “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”should be used. \nBy analogy if “A ⇒ B and C” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” and “not (C) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. If “A ⇒ B, C, D…” is tested, because there are limitless propositions deduced from A, the test about A are endless, and become irrefutable. It is not easy to find a simple case to illustrate this situation of unrestrained, which will be pointed out when it occurs.\n“Scientific faults” are refutable statements and have been refuted by facts. For example; there are two conflicting theories of Heliocentric and Geocentric on the relationship between sun and earth.\nWhich of them is true? How to test them? Copernicus argued that if Heliocentric were true, then Venus would be waxing and waning like the moon, which is \"A ⇒ B\" where A is Heliocentric, and B is the Venus' phase. So the test condition for this statement is that if the Venus were not waxing and waning, Heliocentric would be false, which is \"not (A) ⇒ not (B)\". Heliocentric can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. On the other hand, Geocentric can also present its refutable condition: if the Venus were waxing and waning, Geocentric would be false, so it is scientific too. Afterwards, Galileo observed with a telescope, found that the Venus does be waxing and waning, which refuted Geocentric and supported Heliocentric. Then Geocentric is scientifically false because it has been reputed though it is reputable. By contrast, Heliocentric is not only refutable but also true, because the observation of Galileo does not refute it. \"Reputability\" is the characteristic of science, while \"Refuted\" is the end of false theories, which should not be confused with each other.\nThus human observes the reality, exact the laws out of facts, then make up science theories which can be used to explain what has happened and predict what will happen. If the explanations and predictions have not been refuted by facts, then theories can be accepted as true. But if they are refuted, the theories need to be revised, or even abandoned entirely.\nThe example of Heliocentric illustrates that the theories accepted as true are not true. More accurately speaking, they are just not refuted for now, which does not mean that they will never be refuted in the future, because they are always refutable in science. In fact, with the development of Astronomy, Heliocentric theory has been revised from the idea that all planets, including the Earth, move around the Sun from the centric orbits to the oval orbits. Now the heliocentric theory has been abandoned and replaced by the theory of cosmic expansion because the sun is no longer believed as the center of the Universe.\nLogics also deny that science or refutable theories can be absolutely true. For example, even human has seen thousands of white swans and find no one is black; still, they cannot conclude that there are no black ones in the world. The statement “all swans are white” can be accepted as true, but just for now.\nOf course, only scientifically true theories are desirable, because they can increase human’s knowledge and guide the practice. As mentioned above, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, human firstly tries to explain what has happened to construct theories, then with which predict what will happen by observing if the predictions come true, human test the theories again and again.\nIt seems rather abstract, so let us take examples to illustrate the above interpretation. In Physics, Newton’s laws explain or deduct the phenomenon of an apple falling on the ground. They are accepted as true because we never see an apple flying to the sky. Airplanes that can fly to the sky are invented, which does not violate but apply Newton’s laws. As long as the conditions required by Newton’s laws are satisfied, airplanes never fall from the sky, which proves the laws are true. \nSo, why is Economics scientific?\nEconomics is a set of systematic theories deduced from a postulate which is “human are all self-interested”, and an axiom which is the Law of Demand. Economics can be used to explain some phenomena that cannot be explained by Physics. For example, there is a $100 bill in a public place. Physics can explain why it is gone with the wind. However, it cannot explain why the bill is still gone without wind which only can be explained by economics.\nThe Theory of Supply and Demand (TSD) introduced in later lectures argues that the price will rise if the demand exceeds the supply, while the price will fall if the supply exceeds the demand. As long as the conditions required by the TSD are satisfied, it has never been refuted. If the government imposes price control, forbidding sellers to increase prices when the demand exceeds supply, it seems that the price does not rise, but it does in the other form, such as the time spent on queuing and the red pockets paid as bribe. The logic is similar to the fact of airplanes flying to the sky does not violate Newton’s laws. So, it just proves that the TSD is true again. \n\n\n1. This section introduces the key points of MS.

What is the difference? Physics studies matter, while economics studies human, which is the fundamental difference.\nWhy is it a fundamental difference? Because economists are human too! In other words, economists themselves are also the study objects. Chemistry is a natural science, of which the study object is a molecule, while the studiers are human. What happens if molecules study themselves? Since economists as studiers and their study objects are all human, it causes much trouble. \nFirstly, human has emotion, while science requires objective analysis where subjective emotion should be ruled out. It is easy for natural scientists with the matter as a study object to do so, while rather tricky for social scientists who themselves are also human to rule out their emotions. Economic issues often arouse social disputes with anger. Anger is precisely a kind of emotion which should be ruled out in the discussion of economic issues since economics is a science. Anger can never be used to discuss issues of physics; however, once issues are economical, it is difficult to rule out the emotion of anger! \nSecondly, the postulate of economics is the self-interest of human. Economists are, of course, self-interested too, which cause a severe problem: some economists do not objectively analyze issues with economic theories, but distort their analysis intentionally or unintentionally and make the conclusions beneficial to them. For example, there are many debates on the issue of property prices in China. Different economists have very different opinions. No wonder the public doubt if economics is a science.\nThere is a joke that ten economists would have eleven opinions on the same economic issue. There are three reasons for this weird phenomenon:\n(1) As mentioned in the previous lecture, there are still so many mistakes in economics nowadays. Only wrong conclusions can be made by analysis with wrong theories.\n(2) Economics is rather simple but very difficult to apply. So there is a great distinction between a master and a lame duck. A skillful woodcarver can make a masterpiece out of wood while a clumsy one cannot make anything. Similarly, the second-rate or unqualified economists can only make the wrong conclusion even with correct economic theories.\n(3) It may be the most key reason. As mentioned above, the self-interested economists distort their analysis to make the conclusions most beneficial to them. It is neither because the theories are wrong, nor because they do not understand how to use the theories correctly, but because they need these conclusions beneficial to them.\nNatural science such as physics has the advantage that it can avoid the distortions by self-interest and emotion of human. However, this kind of distortion did occur in the history of the developments of natural science. It may be not well-known that Newton was not a good guy. Historians believe that the fight for the invention of calculus between Newton and Leibniz had postponed the development of mathematics in the UK by at least a century. Besides, he was so narrow-minded that he severely squeezed Hooker, another famous physicist, out.\nThere is a real story in “The Passions of the Mind”, a biography of Freud. When Freud began his career as a psychiatrist, in medicine, there was a wrong thought and people believed that only females would suffer from hysteria because they thought psychosis was only for those with weak willing. Due to this discrimination for female, psychiatrists at that time, never thought about the possibility of male patients. \nHowever, Freud found some cases of male patients of hysteria in the clinic. Napoleon was a patient of hysteria, which showed that hysteria had nothing to do with a weak will and that even males can get hysteria. Nevertheless, at that time, the prejudice for female was so strong that such ridiculous thought was prevalent even though medicine is natural science with the human body instead of a human being as its study object.\nFreud published his finding in an academic paper which caused criticisms and attack on him overwhelmingly. He did not take them seriously but was surprised and upset by the criticism of a massively respected elder in medicine whom he adored. He felt puzzled why the elder who is more experienced than him refused to admit that there were male patients of hysteria. \nDue to the intense criticisms, Freud lost his reputation and even job. Many years later, when the respected elder was dying, he called Freud to his bed and said: “In fact, no one in the world knows more clearly than I that you are right, because I am a male patient of hysteria myself.”\nThe respected elder was not ignorant. Precisely because he knew undoubtedly, he could not accept the truth. If one refuses to accept the truth because of ignorance, he cannot be educated. Nevertheless, if the truth is adverse to his benefits, it is in vain to try to persuade him by reasoning. There is a Chinese saying that a scholar cannot reason with a soldier. That is because the soldier does not intend to reason with him. It is the same for those who want to hide their selfish desires by disguising to reason.\nThus natural science with the matter as study object has the same problem as economics. However, natural science has the advantage that it can do controllable experiments in labs to test theories. Different persons have different interests, so it is usually not easy for natural science is manipulated by a few persons. While the lab of economics is the uncontrollable real world, so it is much easier for few economists to take advantage of the public’s ignorance and the emotion to distort the economic analysis and make conclusions beneficial to them at the expense of the reputation of all economists as a whole.\nThe public is confused to see different economists have such divergent opinions on the same issue hence doubt if economics is a science like physics. It is some economists instead of economics that should carry the blames.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: THE ECOLOGIST, THE ECONOMIST, AND THE STATISTICIAN1\nIn 1990 the ecologist and popular author Paul Ehrlich sent a check for $576.07 to the economist Julian L. Simon. It was a payoff on a bet made 10 years previously. Ehrlich, though not an economist, had made startling economic predictions in his 1968 best-seller The Population Bomb. Take, for example, his opening sentences: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.”\nEhrlich’s predictions utterly failed. Despite an “oil crisis” in mid-decade and again toward the end, overall the 1970s were a decade of remarkable economic growth. Yet the author continued to be highly acclaimed. In books, speeches, and articles that received worldwide attention, he prophesied that accessible supplies of many key minerals would be nearly depleted by 1985.\nMeanwhile the economist Julian L. Simon had been predicting just the reverse for the1970s and1980s: “continuing improvements in human well-being, and lower prices for raw materials. Simon challenged Ehrlich to back his contrary forecast with hard cash, and Ehrlich accepted the challenge. The result was a 1980 bet about whether the prices of five important metals – chrome, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten – would, after allowing for inflation, rise or fall by 1990. The economist let the ecologist choose specific commodities\". Once again, economist Simon was proved right and Ehrlich wrong. The 1980s were also a decade of prosperity, and raw materials prices generally fell. The ecologist had to pay off on the bet.\nEhrlich’s analytic error was to look only at the demand side, and specifically at a growing world population (more mouths to feed). Julian Simon, with his better economic understanding, also considered the supply side. More people mean more mouths, but also more hands and brains. Simon also took account of other favorable economic trends such as greater liberalization of national economies and increased international trade.\nSo the predictions of economic analysis were vindicated. Nevertheless, Paul Ehrlich continued to publish highly popular books forecasting, as mistakenly as before, environmental doom in the near future. Just as regularly, up to his death in 1998 Julian Simon was providing sound analysis and well-validated economic forecasts, culminating in his volume The Ultimate Resource (2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1998). But none of his books was best-sellers.\nWhat was going on here? An economic interpretation might be that these two authors were supplying different commodities. Julian Simon was supplying correct economic analysis. Paul Ehrlich was and is in a different business, somewhat comparable to horror-story writers such as Stephen King. Evidently, at least when it comes to selling books, the demand for horror stories far exceeds the demand for sound economic analysis. [ For a detailed history of the Ehrlich-Simon wager see John Tierney, “Betting the Planet,” New York Times Magazine, December 2, 1990.]\nA later exhaustive and careful study by the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg (The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001) has updated Simon’s results. Initially intending to refute Simon’s analysis, Lomborg found his research instead of confirming it. Despite the rising world population, per capita incomes have maintained their upward trend and real prices of essential resources have continued to fall.\nAs a rather strange sidelight, upon publishing these results, Lomborg became the target of personal attacks that reached an extraordinary level of intensity. At one of his public presentations, a cream pie was dumped on his face and clothing. He was even accused of “intellectual dishonesty” by a scientific body with official standing in Denmark. Ultimately, all the charges were conclusively refuted, and the improperly motivated proceeding against Lomborg was dismissed. (Which does not necessarily mean, of course, that all of Lomborg’s estimates and forecasts will ultimately prove to be correct.)\nOne possible lesson: sound economic analysis can sometimes be riskier than one might think2\n\nThe material above shows that Ehrlich was not an economist, and facts had refuted his analysis, but his books were still more popular than those by Simon as an economist. Why? Because the demand for Ehrlich’s book is the same as for horror fictions instead of correct economic analysis. Ehrlich kept writing books full of mistakes, not to provide correct economic analysis, but to attract readers as an alarmist. There are similar cases in China too. Who should carry the blames, economics, or some so-called economists?\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that when people enjoy themselves by reading horror fictions, they know that they are just fictions, it will not feel panic. Who would believe that the film of “2012” would become real, and be so horrified to sell out their properties or even commit suicide? But when some economists, with the name of a scientist, are engaged in faking horror fictions, the consequences will be severe. The public thought what they provide were correct economic analysis, but they only make alarmist remarks to earn money. If the government does believe them and implement economic policies according to the analysis of such economists, the consequence will be disastrous.\n\n\n1.

Many readers may believe that those individuals major in economics are easier to find good jobs (and jobs with high incomes), or learn to know how to earn money. In reality, those whose careers are economic-related do have higher incomes, but they are not the richest ones while the richest ones may not be those major in economics or even have never learned economics.\nAs an economics teacher, I hope that the readers would master the way of thinking like an economist as most are not, and will not be economists. They do not need to be economists, but they need to think like economists. \nAs mentioned above, economics is a science, analyzing problems objectively just like natural science. However, natural science only teaches us how to analyze problems about the matter, while economics teaches us how to analyze the problems about human. To learn to think like an economist is to learn to analyze problems objectively, ruling out emotions like anger, as this should be economics most benefit to ordinary people.\nBesides, some economists distort economics analysis for their interests and try to mislead the public and governments to benefit themselves. Therefore, if one has learned economics, he will not be fooled by such economists. Mrs. Robinson, a famous British female economist, once said: “I study economics in order to avoid being deceived by economists.” That is also my Motto.\n"},"Lecture03/":{"url":"Lecture03/","title":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics\nIn the last lecture, we have clarified that economics is a science. Science starts from one or some postulates and axioms, and through logical deduction constructs a theoretical system that can explain facts. Therefore, in this chapter, we are going to introduce the postulate of economics.\n"},"Lecture03/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Self-interest\nThe postulate of economics is \"Self-interest\" or more grandly \"Rationality\".\nThe postulate of Self-interest means that human will try to achieve the best result with the lowest cost. It can be regarded as a biological instinct of animals. Under different circumstances, \"the least cost\" can be equivalent to the lowest price of money spent or the minimal resources consumed, while \"best results\" can be equivalent to the maximal income or revenue.\nCaution: self-interest does not mean to benefit oneself by harming others unless harming others is the least costly way to realize one's self-interest goal. In fact, in most cases, in order to benefit oneself with the least cost, one can better act altruistically. As mentioned in Lecture 1, there is a famous example in the book, Wealth of Nation written by the founder of economics, Adam Smith. It says: the baker bakes bread for his good. He wants to earn money from buyers, but as a result, it also meets their needs. So, subjectively he is doing the job for his good, but objectively he is providing us with food, which benefits himself and others at the same time. He could rob people to get money, but that would put himself in jail. Also, he could beg for money, but few people would be willing to give beggar money for nothing, which means begging would not earn him as much as selling bread. After comparing the costs of the different ways of getting money, he chooses the one with the lowest cost and the highest income, which generally is selling bread. \nOf course, if the place where baker lives had poor public security, robbery would become easier, because the risk of being caught would not be high enough. When committing crime costs less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. Thus, the choice between obeying the law and committing a crime is also the result of selfish-interest by measuring incomes and costs. Actually, beggars are said to have a higher income than bakers; however, not too much people are willing to be beggars, because bakers are more respectable, which means that the so-called income should not narrowly be considered as monetary income, but also contains reputation, dignity, and other non-monetary income. So, incomes include monetary ones and non-monetary. The same applies to costs. If one does not choose to be a beggar, the total incomes of beggar must be not higher than those of baker, and the total costs are not lower, which implies that self-interest dominates his behavior.\nLet us think about this phenomenon more profound. Why do bakers earn more non-monetary incomes than beggars? Due to morality, bakers are respected while beggars are belittled. However, why is morality as such? Because bakers contribute to others and create new wealth by providing bread, while beggars do not contribute to others and create no wealth for society. They transfer wealth from those who donate. In other words, morality guides human to realize self-interest by altruism. That is precisely the reason why human need morality. Morality rewards self-interest acts by altruism, belittles those without benefits to others (such as begging) and condemns those by harming others (such as robbing). Therefore, robbery is not only sanctioned by law but also bears the pressure of moral condemnation which is a non-monetary cost. So morality increases the total costs of robbery. This is the same as the market guiding human to behave altruistically by price and the law preventing them from harming others by penalty.\nTraditional morality makes it shameful to be a beggar, but modern social welfare essentially encourages people to be beggars. The original intention of social welfare is to help the poor, but the real effect is to support the lazy. The reason is straightforward: for one who is not sick or disabled, without the belittling of morality as a non-monetary cost, why not just sit there and live on relief. The national debt crisis of Greece tells this truth: the Greeks are not born to be lazy, and it is the long-term social welfare that makes them so. Also, it corrupts morality which praises self-reliance and belittles idleness. People feel no shame in taking it for granted to ask for money from the government, and scold government no matter it refuses or gives less than before. \n"},"Lecture03/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True","keywords":"","body":"﻿# Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True\nSomeone may argue, “I am not self-interested. It is wrong that economics postulates that one is self-interested.” However, the postulates and axioms of science do not need any proof, which means they do not need to be real or genuine. However, they do need to be tested by facts. It means the theories deduced from them can explain phenomena in reality. If they can’t, the postulates and axioms must be modified or even rejected. Therefore, what can reject the postulate of self-interest is the explanation power of theories deducted from it instead of the truth or correctness of it.\nSome experimental economists try to prove that the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong. However, they make an elementary logical mistake. In Lecture 2 about the methodology of science, it has been pointed out that if “A ⇒ B” is tested, then \"not (B) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. One cannot conclude that “A ⇒ B” is wrong because “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”. Thus it is also seriously wrong to refute economics by experiments which refute the postulate of self-interest or rationality.\nLet us consider this imaginary example to show that even if the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong, it can still explain or predict correctly.1There are a group of people who are going to build gas stations, and there are three places available: the highway, the mountain and the desert. Suppose the construction costs are the same in these three places. According to the postulate of self-interest or rationality, economics predicts that they will build gas stations along the highway. Actually they are idiots, so it is totally wrong to postulate them to be self-interested or rational. Nevertheless, it does not matter! These idiots build gas stations just at random, so some of them build the gas stations in the mountain, while some of them in the desert. Of course, some idiots happen to build the gas stations along the highway. After some time, gas stations in the mountain and dessert go bankrupt because income earned cannot cover operational costs while those along the highway are prosperous and survive more in the business. The final result is the same as economic prediction. That is enough! It is not important whether they choose the place to build the gas stations by careful calculation or at random. It is essential that finally there is no gas station in the mountain or the desert, but there are along the highway, so facts have not refuted the economic prediction.\nMilton Friedman (1912-2006) gave another similar example in his book “Price Theory”. Why do plants grow toward the sun? Biology has a theory to explain this phenomenon. The growth of leaves needs sunlight for photosynthesis, so more leaves are growing in the direction toward the sun and vice versa. As time passes, plants appear to grow toward the sun. Economics can also explain this phenomenon. How? Plants are postulated to be self-interested or rational, and the sunlight is beneficial to their growth, so they grow towards the sun. It is wrong to postulate plants to be self-interested or rational. How can plants think? It does not matter. The conclusion of economic explanation can be the same as that of biological explanation.\nThere is a new inter-discipline called bio-economics which uses the postulate of economics to deduce the theories explaining the biological phenomena. Moreover, the biological study also supports the postulate of economics. There is a famous book “The Extended Selfish Gene” in biology. It is well-known that species evolve through genetic mutations. Some mutations conform to the nature of selfishness, while some do not. Those genes without the nature of selfishness will be eliminated in natural selection, while those who are selfish survive. The survivors keep duplicating their genes and multiply, which makes selfishness continuously strengthened and inherited, thus ultimately determines that all species, including human, are selfish. Isn’t this process similar to the example of building gas stations by the idiots? Genetic mutations are random, just like the choices of the idiots. Nevertheless, natural selection determines that only the gas stations or genes conforming to the nature of selfishness can survive. It is well-known that Darwin’s idea is natural selection or survival of the fittest, but few know that the exposition inspired him about the self-interest of human in Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”.\nHowever, it is not crucial whether a human is self-interested or not, or whether he is selfish due to the genes as “The Extended Selfish Gene” suggests, because self-interest is a postulate which does not need to be proved but must be accepted. If one does not accept it, then it is better not to study economics. Of course, one can invent a subject with the postulate of un-self-interest. Those who study this subject must accept it, but the theories deducted from it need to be tested by facts. If facts do not refute the theories, one will succeed in establishing a brand-new subject called Economics of Un-self-interest, while the economics now may be renamed as Economics of Self-interest. However, if facts refute one's theories, he has to modify or even abandon the postulate of un-self-interest. No one has been able to do so, because the theories deducted from the postulate of un-self-interest are easily refuted by facts and cannot be established as a subject.\nIn geometry, however, it did happen that new subjects were established by changing postulates. The geometry learned in middle school is “Euclidean geometry” because ancient Greek Euclid established it. There are five postulates in Euclidean geometry. Among them, the axiom derived from the fifth postulate is called “the parallel axiom” that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one”. However, in the 19th century, a Russian adopted a contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, at least two new lines can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” As a result, a new set of geometry theories without logical contradiction within it was deduced based on this new axiom. Later on, another German also deduced another set of new geometry theories without logical contradiction within it based on another contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, no new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” Eventually, the geometry based on the parallel axiom is called Euclidean geometry, while those based on alternative axioms other than the parallel one are collectively called non-Euclidean geometries.\nScience is like this: In the first stage, there are one or several postulates which need not be proved, nor need it be true or real, but all in this discipline must accept and abide by the postulates. Anyone can establish new subjects based on different postulates, but whether they are successfully established must be tested by facts.\n\n\n1. This imaginary example is adapted from “The Science of Demand”, the 1st volume of the 1st edition of “Economic Explanation” by Steven N. S. Cheung, The Arcadia Press, May 2001, P44. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed\nSince economics has postulated human to be self-interested, it can not postulate human to be un-self-interested at the same time. In other words, one can not explain human behaviours with un-self-interest, or there can not be cases of un-self-interest. It is the same as Geometry: there can not be any theories that are contradictory to the parallel axiom in Euclidean Geometry. It is also the same as laws. The constitution is the fundamental law of a nation just like postulates and axioms of science. There can not be any laws that are contradictory to the constitution, or else they must be amended or even abolished.\nWhat would happen if economics postulated human to be both self-interested and un-self-interested at the same time? If it was the case, then economics could be able to explain any phenomena, but actually, economics had not been able to explain it all.\nFor instance, why does one cheat others for money: It is because he is self-interested. Moreover, why does one donate money to others? Because he is un-self-interested.\nEconomics seems to have explained both the behaviors, but neither has been explained. When would on earth one be self-interested, and when would he be un-self-interested? How to predict if one would cheat or donate money in advance? As mentioned before, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, theories are more needed to help to predict the future. If human were postulated to be both self-interested and un-self-interested, it would be impossible to predict their behaviors and be impossible to explain when they will cheat or donate money. This scenario brings out the specific case of tautology.\nHowever, it would also be false to answer like that: why does one cheat others of money? Is it because he is self-interested, or why does one donate money to others? Is it because he is un-self-interested?\nSelf-interest is a postulate which can not apply directly to explain phenomena; otherwise, the explanations with it are directly postulated. It would happen again that any phenomena could be explained, but actually, they had not been explained at all, which is also the case of tautology. This scenario shows how it is easy to make the mistakes of tautology!\nIt is relatively easy to explain why one chooses to cheat. As mentioned before, when committing a crime was costing less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. The explanations for both phenomena are similar. If cheating is an easy way of getting money, and would not be caught by the police, one would tend to do so.\nHow about donating? If the donatee is a rich kid and he can go to school even without donations, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the donatee is a poor kid and he cannot go to school without donations, one would tend to donate to him.\nFurthermore, if the poor kid has no intention of study and donations would not make him study well, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the kid has the passion and intelligence to study and just lack of money, one would tend to donate to him.\nStill, furthermore, suppose there is a charity and one needs to go a few miles to donate, one would tend to do so. In contrast, if one has to drive or take a car to the backwaters thousands of miles away to donate directly, he would not take such trouble. If there is a severe charity scandal exposed, one finds out that his donations have been abused instead of helping the poor, he would not tend to donate again.1\nThe effect of a charity scandal on donations can be used to demonstrate the methodology of science introduced in the previous lecture. Suppose there are three kinds of economics: Economics of Self-interest, Economics of Un-self-interest, and Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. A charity scandal will be used to test which of them is scientifically valid.\nAccording to the postulate of Economics of Self-interest, if there are scandals, then donations to charity will decline, but if they increase, then Economics of Self-interest is refuted. This situation can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. Donations do drop dramatically after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is scientifically true.\nIn contrast, according to the postulate of Economics of Un-self-interest, donations to the charity will increase due to scandals, but if they decline, Economics of Un-self-interest is refuted. It can present the refutable condition, so it is scientific. However, the donations drop after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is a scientific fault. It is too easy to refute Economics of Un-self-interest by facts; no wonder no one has ever tried to establish such economics.\nHow about Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest? Can it represent the refutable condition? No way! If the donations to the charity decline, it will say because human is self-interested now; while if they increase, it will say because human is un-self-interested now. It is always true, no matter what happens. However, precisely due to its irrefutability, it is a tautology instead of a science. One may doubt if there would be such ridiculous economics. Of course, there is, but with higher-sounding names. Earlier there was a concept of \"bounded rationality\" that prevailed for a while, and the idea of \"irrationality\" has been alive until now. Besides, there is \"behavioral economics\" which is rather popular and hot at present. The nature of all above is Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. There are full of such non-scientific concepts and ideas in mainstream economics; no wonder it is despised by natural scientists.\nIn short, although donating is a kind of philanthropy which seems to be contrary to the postulate of self-interest, in fact, it is dominated by self-interest. Self-interest means that people will try to achieve the best results with the least cost. When one wants to help others, he still wants to achieve the best result for this goal with the least cost. So it is better to donate to poor kids rather than to rich ones. It is better to donate to the hard-working kids other than to those without the intention of studying. Moreover, it costs less to distribute the donations by a reputable charity. However, if the charity is not reliable at all, it is better to send directly to the donatees by oneself. Thus, the fact that human is altruistic has not refuted the postulate of self-interest. Because even if altruism is the result one wants to achieve, he still wants to achieve it with the least cost, which means that self-interest still dominates his behaviors.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain donating, but we can show how self-interest dominates the choices of a donator under different constraints. \"Constraint\" is a fundamental concept in economics, meaning the objective restriction on human's behaviors. Self-interest is also a restriction on human behaviors, but it is a postulate, needs not to be true and not an objective fact, while constraint must be.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain human behaviors in economics. Instead, we need to point out different constraints and predict what a self-interested person will do under such constraints. This is both a prediction and an explanation. Finally, we need to investigate whether the person does do so as we predict. If he does, that means facts have tested the postulate of self-interest; otherwise, it has been refuted.\nNeither can the postulate of self-interest directly apply to explain robbery or cheating. Different constraints are: one is that the police are powerful, and robbers and cheaters will be caught and punished. Under such a constraint, self-interested people will not choose to commit crimes. The other is the opposite situation, and it is more profitable to commit a crime.\nIn conclusion, there are different choices or behaviors of human not because human are sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because of different constraints. We can not apply economics to explain what has happened or predict what will happen by changing the postulate of self-interest, but investigating the change of constraints. \n\n\n1. Some may argue that there is a trick with the concept of donation in the explanation. Upon donating, the question is why one chooses to donate? Rather than why one chooses to donate to a poor and hard-working kid after he had chosen to donate. Indeed, there are two aspects of questions about donation. Firstly, why does one choose to donate, or why does one not keep the money for his use? Secondly, having chosen to donate, how does one choose to donate with the least costs and best result. The explanation here is the answer to the second question. The first question has been answered when it is discussed why human needs morality in the first section of this lecture. More specifically, suppose there are two persons in a society, and one is poor while the other is rich. If there were no morality, the rich one would only think about himself, while the poor one would die of starvation. Then only the rich will survive, but the question is how long he could survive in competition with other animals after he is alone in the society? However, if there is morality, the rich would donate his surplus to the poor one who would not die of starvation, and thus the competition with other animals will be minimal, and a chance for survival will be higher in comparison to if he was left alone.This example shows that morality is precisely the result of selfish-interest of all human beings as a whole who tries to maximize the chances of survival in competitions with other species. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness\nIn Mainstream Economics or textbooks, there are often mistakes of being a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, because there are so many theories about \"irrationality\". For instance, it is said that there is irrational exuberance when the stock market is rising too much. As mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, the meaning of self-interest and rationality is the same. If one is said to be irrational, it means he is un-self-interested, which is a conflict with the postulate of economics, so it is a serious mistake. Some economists would be cautious about saying that it is difficult to judge how much the stock index could be regarded as irrationality. However, it is not the problem of how to judge if the stock index is irrational or not. It is forbidden in economics to use irrationality to explain human behaviors, which is the same as it is forbidden in non-Euclidean geometry to use the parallel axiom.\nNo matter how crazily the price of a stock rises, it is rational. That sounds too ridiculous to accept. Nevertheless, the critical point is: that human is self-interested or rational does not mean they are sure to make correct choices. The crazily rising of a stock price is the result of the investors' rational choices which may not be correct. Are rational or self-interested choices correct? Regardless of the cases mentioned before that committing crimes is rational but morally wrong behavior, here is another case. One is rational to make a choice, which means he believes he can achieve the best result with the lowest cost, but he may find he is wrong in the end. In other words, he has not achieved the best result or paid a higher price.\nTake the stock investment as an example. One must believe the price of the stock he is going to buy would rise. However, the price of the stock may fall after he bought, so he suffered a loss. Was he irrational? No, he only made a mistake in his expectation of the stock price.\nMoreover, why did he make a mistake? Because he is not the omniscient God! He thought that the stock price would rise, but it falls eventually. If he could know the price would fall in advance, of course, he would not choose to buy the stock. It is not because he is irrational, but because he does not know! If he knew the price would fall in advance, but he still chose to buy the stock, then the postulate of rationality would have been refuted by facts. That has never happened.\nHuman is rational, but he is not omniscient, which means ignorance is a constraint. Some have reliable inside information of the stock market, and know more than others or are less constrained, so their choices are more correct than those who are relatively ignorant. They are not more rational than others, but just under a different constraint. It is always the difference of constraints rather than rationality or irrationality that causes different human behaviors and their results.\nLet us consider another example in reality for illustration. A student of economics posted in an economic forum that a classmate of his had not been going to take the postgraduate entrance examination. However, later he heard that someone not as good as he had passed the examination, so he completely changed his decision. The poster felt doubt that his classmate changed his decision just due to hearing such a piece of news. Is it right for economics to postulate human to be rational?\nHas it refuted the postulate of rationality? Of course not. The classmate was not going to take the postgraduate entrance examination, of which he must have estimated the cost and benefit. He had to choose to spend time preparing for the exam or job hunting. Once he failed in the exam, neither had a job, he would suffer a significant loss. In the beginning, he estimated the exam to be very difficult. It must be because of the information he had that made him believe that he had little chance to pass. He rationally gave up the exam after the calculation the cost and benefit. Later, he got some new information that someone not as good as he had passed the exam, so he adjusted his estimation about the exam, which means the constraints have changed. Thanks to the new information, he now knows better about the difficulty of the exam or becomes less ignorant than he was before. Along with the change of constraints, his choice or behavior also changed. If he knew that a postgraduate degree was better than a graduate job and he could pass the exam, but he still did not change his choice, then we would have arrived in conclusion that postulate of rationality has been refuted. Remember: it is always the change of constraints other than the postulate of self-interest or rationality that can be used to explain human's behaviors.\nSome economists suggest that the reasons why self-interested or rational people cannot make correct choices are divided into ignorance and uncertainty. However, they are the same because uncertainty means it is impossible to completely know the future, which is equivalent to the ignorance of the future.\nIgnorance is also a constraint which is defined as transaction cost in economics. Transaction cost is a fundamental but complicated concept, so it will not be explained in detail until the later lecture in this book. However, this concept is so indispensable that we need to frequently apply it to almost every issue of economics before that lecture. A reader can take his time to comprehend it by observing how it is applied.\nOne kind of transaction costs is information cost which is the cost of acquiring information. Ignorance is precisely due to information cost. One would choose to be ignorant rationally when there is too high information cost. Ignorance is a rational choice! One can benefit from knowing more, for which he has to pay formation cost. If the information cost is higher than the benefit, it is not worth knowing more, so it is rational to choose to be ignorant. When one becomes more enlightened, he is constrained less by information cost.\nAs mentioned above, uncertainty is the ignorance of the future. Human has made great efforts to predict the future, including weather prediction, earthquake prediction and even such unscientific means as fortune-telling. Great efforts imply tremendous information costs. To sum up, information cost is one kind of transaction costs, and transaction cost is a significant constraint that would affect human's behaviors. \n"},"Lecture03/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest\nEconomics postulates human to be self-interested. It does not matter whether it is true or false. What does matter is facts have not rejected the results deduced from it. If the government does not take this postulate into account, or even just not carefully enough, there would be unexpected effects of policy implementation which would even run counter to the original intentions. For example, social welfare is intended to help the poor and the weak, but it makes them lazy and even corrupts morality. There are such counterproductive policies everywhere in reality. The policy-makers should be cautious: do not just think that the original intentions are good, but try to have a guess what the self-interested people would respond with a countermeasure.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: RATIONAL DRIVERS?1\nAir-bags reduce, on average, the severity of auto injuries and the risk of death from motor accidents. However, given that additional safety margin, it might well be rational for motorists to drive more aggressively!\nIs such an adaptation observed? Steven Peterson, George Hoffer, and Edward Millner examined statistics collected by the state of Virginia about fatal two-car accidents in 1993.   In 30 such accidents, one car was equipped with an air-bag, and the other was not. The accident reports identified in each case the supposed \"initiator\" the party was driving more aggressively. The table indicates that in 22 of the 30 accidents (73%) the initiators drove cars with air-bags, although only 50% of the cars involved in accidents were air-bag equipped. So, the indications are, having an air-bag increased the likelihood of a driver to initiate an accident.\nTwo-car accidents with/without air-bags (Virginia, 1993)\n\n\n\n\nWith air-bags\nWithout air-bags\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cars\n30 (50%)\n30 (50%)\n\n\nNumber of \"initiators\"\n22 (73%)\n8 (27%)\n\n\n\nSource: Adapted from Peterson et >al., p. 262.\nAny single bit of evidence such as this can only be indicative, not conclusive. Moreover, even if entirely valid, these results do not necessarily imply that regulations requiring air-bags are inadvisable. Although drivers of airbag-equipped vehicles may indeed be more inclined to take risks, the increased aggressiveness may not entirely cancel out the overall beneficial safety effect of air-bags.\n\nThis reading material illustrates that air-bags are equipped to reduce the damage of accidents, the intention of which is good. However, the result is out of expectation. Because of the reduction of the damage of a car accident, drivers become aggressive in driving. Under the constraint of the cars equipped with air-bags, the costs of aggressive driving decrease from severe disability or even death to minor injury or disability. As a result, drivers tend to drive faster. The risk of severe damage caused by a car accident is reduced, while that of the happening of car accidents increases. So the number of victims of accidents may increase. The result is uncertain for drivers, but for pedestrians without air-bags on their backs, they are sure to be harmed. Then for the whole society, air-bags equipped in cars may do more harm than good.\nIn order to eliminate crimes, some have suggested a death penalty to be imposed on all crimes regardless of their severities. However, once the severity of the penalty was out of line with that of crime, the costs and benefits faced by a criminal would be distorted, and he would make distorted choices. Just imagine what would happen if a nation did do so. The criminal rate would certainly plunge, and minor offences such as stealing would almost disappear, but serious crimes such as murder would increase. Why? Suppose now one was out of money and with no option but to steal or rob. Meanwhile, the police's detection rate cannot be 100%. In other words, one might not be caught and punished. So what kind of crimes would one opt to commit? Will one opt for petty stealing or robbing a bank? The consequences of being caught in both cases would be the same: death penalty. The same costs with different revenues, what would one choose? The answer is obvious. The legislation should base on objective analysis instead of passion, or else there would be horrible consequences. No nation has implemented such a death penalty, which implies it is unfit to survive.\n\n\n1. This reading material is an excerpt from \"Price Theory and Its Application\", P9. ↩\n\n"}}}
