1: Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 1: Introduction\nBefore the study of economics, it is necessary to remind readers that never believe the ordinary textbooks of economics without thinking.\nIn general, textbooks are the truth. However, it is not the case for economics. There are many mistakes in the books of economics.\nWhy? Because economics is too young.\nLet me introduce the history of Economics. A question: when was USA independent? The answer: in 1776. It is the same year that a British named Adam Smith (1723-1790) published his book “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,” which marked the birth of economics. So Adam Smith is the founder of economics. Students and the researchers of economics, including you and me, are his disciples.\nSo you can see how young economics is, just like the USA that is only 200 years old. It is no wonder that there are lots of mistakes in economics. \nNatural science, such as physics, is regarded as truth. However, don't forget that Aristotle started to study it thousands of years ago. It has been developing for thousands of years. There had also been many mistakes in physics. For example, physicists believed that the falling speed of an object was correlating with its mass, which is totally wrong. The falling rate of a stone is faster than the plume’s just because the air friction interferes in. Another example is astronomy. How long had erroneous Geocentric been dominant in astronomy?\nSo it is not a surprise that there are many mistakes in economics because it is only 200 years old. It is a surprise that we entirely believe economics textbooks without thinking. In fact, many authors of economics textbooks do not take all that they write in books for granted. However, textbooks are not academic work, so it is better to follow the majority. Nevertheless, truth is often in the hand of the minority.\nHowever, I decided to write a textbook on economics which does not follow the majority. I will select only the correct contents from ordinary textbooks of economics, criticize the mistakes and add something new and correct. Therefore, this book looks somewhat different from the usual textbooks of economics.\nSomeone would doubt whether the truth is subject to my judgment. How can we know the truth objectively? We need an assistant: Methodology of Science (MS) or Philosophy of Science which provides an objective analysis of whether a subject is a science. It applies not only for economics but also for all kinds of sciences. The scholars of MS establish the rules of science form the practice of natural science. So it makes one significant distinction between ordinary textbooks and this book that there are many introductions of MS in this book. In my opinion, the best way to master MS for those who are not the students of philosophy or logics is to learn economics.\nBesides, this book is suitable for both students major in economics and amateurs. There is some math in this book for the economics students to study, while for beginners, math is not essential, though understanding it does help to understand economics better. But you do not need to be anxious if you cannot understand the math in this book, because the application of economics does not rely on math.\nThis textbook inherits the academic discipline from “Economics Explanation” by Steven N.G Cheung. The references of traditional economics textbook are mainly from “Theory of Price and Application” written by Cheung’s teacher Jack Hirshleifer (1925-2005). Cheung wrote a preface “The Experience of Learning -- Preface for My Teacher’s Textbook” for its Chinese version translated by Zhou Yan and me. In the preface, He suggested that students read the “Theory of Price and Application” with critical thinking instead of belief. It is more important to raise questions and discuss with classmates or teachers. That is the real study!\nI would like to share these words with all the readers of this book as an encouragement!\n\f\n"},"Lecture02/":{"url":"Lecture02/","title":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science\nEconomics is a social science, which is the subject nature of it. However, what does it mean? This lecture will explain it with the methodologies of science.\n"},"Lecture02/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture02/Section01.html","title":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability","keywords":"","body":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability1\nEconomics is a science. Science is an activity of human intelligence. It starts from one or several postulates or axioms from which a set of theories and inferences are established as a system. Besides, all the conclusions of this theoretical system must be tested by fact.\nThis definition of “Science” can be divided into three stages also known as “Trilogy of Science”.\nThe first stage is postulates and axioms, which is the starting point of science. It does not need proof; neither needs to be true; it just needs to be accepted without any doubts. Sceptics doubt everything including those as a starting point. But what can be done without a starting point?\nThe second stage is a logical deduction. Mathematics as a tool assisting logical deduction may be useful for science. However, Math is not science itself, but a useful tool for the second stage of science.\nThe third stage is the fact test, which makes the distinction between science and math: there are only the previous two stages in math (Geometry is a typical instance). Without this third stage, math is not science. Since the first stage of science needs no proof and does not allow any doubts, it seems very arbitrary and even unreasonable. Then how can be it sure to be OK? That is why science needs the support of fact in the third stage.\nIt is the third stage that distinguishes science from math. Therefore, an essential feature of science is not provability, but refutability. That is, fact can refute it2.\nThere is a serious and rather common misunderstanding about science that should be clarified. The public usually presumes that science is equivalent to truth. This is a misconception as they are totally different. A statement with refutability is scientific; otherwise, it is non-scientific. The false is the refuted but the truth is not the unrefuted. Therefore, it is not contradictory to say science is false and non-science is true.\nLet us consider this example of unscientific truth: a four-footed animal has four feet. It is impossible to find a fact to refute this statement, which means it is absolutely true. However, what is irrefutable is exactly unscientific. Think about it deeply; why is that the statement cannot be falsified or refuted? Because the former part of it just repeats the latter part. In other words, A is B, so B is A. Such un-scientific, but true statement is called tautology which means repetition. Human study science in order to discover new knowledge, but tautology does not add any new knowledge; instead, it only repeats what already established. That is why tautology is absolutely true but becomes unscientific.\nTautology is not the only case of irrefutable statements. There are also four kinds of unscientific statements: unreality, ambiguity, contradiction and unrestrained.\nThe statement of “God exists.” is unscientific; instead, it is associated more with religion. The question here is why so? This is because the concept of God is not a fact, and it cannot be tested by facts, which leads to irrefutability.\nSeen from another point of view, the concept “God” is ambiguous, which also leads to irrefutability. Superstition, which is somewhat similar to religion, tries to avoid being refuted with ambiguity. \nHere is a story: Three students go to take an important public examination. They meet a fortune-teller on the road, so ask him to predict their examination results. The fortune-teller just raises a finger and says nothing. \nPossible outcomes: If one of them passes the examination, that one-finger means one succeeds. If two of them pass, it means one of them fails. If all of them pass or do not pass, it means they as a group succeed or fail3. Whatever the result will be, the fortune-teller can redefine the ambiguous meaning of the one-finger to make sure he is always right. However, it is unscientific precisely because it is irrefutable.\nThe statement of “There is a black point on an all-white wall.” is also unscientific. With this contradiction, the conclusion of “The wall is a god” will be deducted. Is it only an omnipotent god who can be both black and white?\nIn a math class at middle schools, they teach that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, only a few know that it is also the way of testing science.\n If “A ⇒ B” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” instead of “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”should be used. \nBy analogy if “A ⇒ B and C” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” and “not (C) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. If “A ⇒ B, C, D…” is tested, because there are limitless propositions deduced from A, the test about A are endless, and become irrefutable. It is not easy to find a simple case to illustrate this situation of unrestrained, which will be pointed out when it occurs.\n“Scientific faults” are refutable statements and have been refuted by facts. For example; there are two conflicting theories of Heliocentric and Geocentric on the relationship between sun and earth.\nWhich of them is true? How to test them? Copernicus argued that if Heliocentric were true, then Venus would be waxing and waning like the moon, which is \"A ⇒ B\" where A is Heliocentric, and B is the Venus' phase. So the test condition for this statement is that if the Venus were not waxing and waning, Heliocentric would be false, which is \"not (A) ⇒ not (B)\". Heliocentric can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. On the other hand, Geocentric can also present its refutable condition: if the Venus were waxing and waning, Geocentric would be false, so it is scientific too. Afterwards, Galileo observed with a telescope, found that the Venus does be waxing and waning, which refuted Geocentric and supported Heliocentric. Then Geocentric is scientifically false because it has been reputed though it is reputable. By contrast, Heliocentric is not only refutable but also true, because the observation of Galileo does not refute it. \"Reputability\" is the characteristic of science, while \"Refuted\" is the end of false theories, which should not be confused with each other.\nThus human observes the reality, exact the laws out of facts, then make up science theories which can be used to explain what has happened and predict what will happen. If the explanations and predictions have not been refuted by facts, then theories can be accepted as true. But if they are refuted, the theories need to be revised, or even abandoned entirely.\nThe example of Heliocentric illustrates that the theories accepted as true are not true. More accurately speaking, they are just not refuted for now, which does not mean that they will never be refuted in the future, because they are always refutable in science. In fact, with the development of Astronomy, Heliocentric theory has been revised from the idea that all planets, including the Earth, move around the Sun from the centric orbits to the oval orbits. Now the heliocentric theory has been abandoned and replaced by the theory of cosmic expansion because the sun is no longer believed as the center of the Universe.\nLogics also deny that science or refutable theories can be absolutely true. For example, even human has seen thousands of white swans and find no one is black; still, they cannot conclude that there are no black ones in the world. The statement “all swans are white” can be accepted as true, but just for now.\nOf course, only scientifically true theories are desirable, because they can increase human’s knowledge and guide the practice. As mentioned above, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, human firstly tries to explain what has happened to construct theories, then with which predict what will happen by observing if the predictions come true, human test the theories again and again.\nIt seems rather abstract, so let us take examples to illustrate the above interpretation. In Physics, Newton’s laws explain or deduct the phenomenon of an apple falling on the ground. They are accepted as true because we never see an apple flying to the sky. Airplanes that can fly to the sky are invented, which does not violate but apply Newton’s laws. As long as the conditions required by Newton’s laws are satisfied, airplanes never fall from the sky, which proves the laws are true. \nSo, why is Economics scientific?\nEconomics is a set of systematic theories deduced from a postulate which is “human are all self-interested”, and an axiom which is the Law of Demand. Economics can be used to explain some phenomena that cannot be explained by Physics. For example, there is a $100 bill in a public place. Physics can explain why it is gone with the wind. However, it cannot explain why the bill is still gone without wind which only can be explained by economics.\nThe Theory of Supply and Demand (TSD) introduced in later lectures argues that the price will rise if the demand exceeds the supply, while the price will fall if the supply exceeds the demand. As long as the conditions required by the TSD are satisfied, it has never been refuted. If the government imposes price control, forbidding sellers to increase prices when the demand exceeds supply, it seems that the price does not rise, but it does in the other form, such as the time spent on queuing and the red pockets paid as bribe. The logic is similar to the fact of airplanes flying to the sky does not violate Newton’s laws. So, it just proves that the TSD is true again. \n\n\n1. This section introduces the key points of MS. Those who are interested in it should read such masterpieces as “The Logic of Scientific Discovery” (Karl Popper, 1902-1994) and “The Philosophy of Natural Science” (Carl G. Hempel, 1905-1997).  ↩\n\n\n2. Here \"Science\" is a narrow-sense concept. Some scholars call those subjects without refutability, such as Logics and Mathematics, as \"Formal Science\", while those with refutability as \"Empirical Science\". That concept of science is a broad-sense one. This book use “Science” in narrow-sense which is refutable, i.e. \"Empirical Science\". ↩\n\n\n3.

What is the difference? Physics studies matter, while economics studies human, which is the fundamental difference.\nWhy is it a fundamental difference? Because economists are human too! In other words, economists themselves are also the study objects. Chemistry is a natural science, of which the study object is a molecule, while the studiers are human. What happens if molecules study themselves? Since economists as studiers and their study objects are all human, it causes much trouble. \nFirstly, human has emotion, while science requires objective analysis where subjective emotion should be ruled out. It is easy for natural scientists with the matter as a study object to do so, while rather tricky for social scientists who themselves are also human to rule out their emotions. Economic issues often arouse social disputes with anger. Anger is precisely a kind of emotion which should be ruled out in the discussion of economic issues since economics is a science. Anger can never be used to discuss issues of physics; however, once issues are economical, it is difficult to rule out the emotion of anger! \nSecondly, the postulate of economics is the self-interest of human. Economists are, of course, self-interested too, which cause a severe problem: some economists do not objectively analyze issues with economic theories, but distort their analysis intentionally or unintentionally and make the conclusions beneficial to them. For example, there are many debates on the issue of property prices in China. Different economists have very different opinions. No wonder the public doubt if economics is a science.\nThere is a joke that ten economists would have eleven opinions on the same economic issue. There are three reasons for this weird phenomenon:\n(1) As mentioned in the previous lecture, there are still so many mistakes in economics nowadays. Only wrong conclusions can be made by analysis with wrong theories.\n(2) Economics is rather simple but very difficult to apply. So there is a great distinction between a master and a lame duck. A skillful woodcarver can make a masterpiece out of wood while a clumsy one cannot make anything. Similarly, the second-rate or unqualified economists can only make the wrong conclusion even with correct economic theories.\n(3) It may be the most key reason. As mentioned above, the self-interested economists distort their analysis to make the conclusions most beneficial to them. It is neither because the theories are wrong, nor because they do not understand how to use the theories correctly, but because they need these conclusions beneficial to them.\nNatural science such as physics has the advantage that it can avoid the distortions by self-interest and emotion of human. However, this kind of distortion did occur in the history of the developments of natural science. It may be not well-known that Newton was not a good guy. Historians believe that the fight for the invention of calculus between Newton and Leibniz had postponed the development of mathematics in the UK by at least a century. Besides, he was so narrow-minded that he severely squeezed Hooker, another famous physicist, out.\nThere is a real story in “The Passions of the Mind”, a biography of Freud. When Freud began his career as a psychiatrist, in medicine, there was a wrong thought and people believed that only females would suffer from hysteria because they thought psychosis was only for those with weak willing. Due to this discrimination for female, psychiatrists at that time, never thought about the possibility of male patients. \nHowever, Freud found some cases of male patients of hysteria in the clinic. Napoleon was a patient of hysteria, which showed that hysteria had nothing to do with a weak will and that even males can get hysteria. Nevertheless, at that time, the prejudice for female was so strong that such ridiculous thought was prevalent even though medicine is natural science with the human body instead of a human being as its study object.\nFreud published his finding in an academic paper which caused criticisms and attack on him overwhelmingly. He did not take them seriously but was surprised and upset by the criticism of a massively respected elder in medicine whom he adored. He felt puzzled why the elder who is more experienced than him refused to admit that there were male patients of hysteria. \nDue to the intense criticisms, Freud lost his reputation and even job. Many years later, when the respected elder was dying, he called Freud to his bed and said: “In fact, no one in the world knows more clearly than I that you are right, because I am a male patient of hysteria myself.”\nThe respected elder was not ignorant. Precisely because he knew undoubtedly, he could not accept the truth. If one refuses to accept the truth because of ignorance, he cannot be educated. Nevertheless, if the truth is adverse to his benefits, it is in vain to try to persuade him by reasoning. There is a Chinese saying that a scholar cannot reason with a soldier. That is because the soldier does not intend to reason with him. It is the same for those who want to hide their selfish desires by disguising to reason.\nThus natural science with the matter as study object has the same problem as economics. However, natural science has the advantage that it can do controllable experiments in labs to test theories. Different persons have different interests, so it is usually not easy for natural science is manipulated by a few persons. While the lab of economics is the uncontrollable real world, so it is much easier for few economists to take advantage of the public’s ignorance and the emotion to distort the economic analysis and make conclusions beneficial to them at the expense of the reputation of all economists as a whole.\nThe public is confused to see different economists have such divergent opinions on the same issue hence doubt if economics is a science like physics. It is some economists instead of economics that should carry the blames.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: THE ECOLOGIST, THE ECONOMIST, AND THE STATISTICIAN1\nIn 1990 the ecologist and popular author Paul Ehrlich sent a check for $576.07 to the economist Julian L. Simon. It was a payoff on a bet made 10 years previously. Ehrlich, though not an economist, had made startling economic predictions in his 1968 best-seller The Population Bomb. Take, for example, his opening sentences: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.”\nEhrlich’s predictions utterly failed. Despite an “oil crisis” in mid-decade and again toward the end, overall the 1970s were a decade of remarkable economic growth. Yet the author continued to be highly acclaimed. In books, speeches, and articles that received worldwide attention, he prophesied that accessible supplies of many key minerals would be nearly depleted by 1985.\nMeanwhile the economist Julian L. Simon had been predicting just the reverse for the1970s and1980s: “continuing improvements in human well-being, and lower prices for raw materials. Simon challenged Ehrlich to back his contrary forecast with hard cash, and Ehrlich accepted the challenge. The result was a 1980 bet about whether the prices of five important metals – chrome, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten – would, after allowing for inflation, rise or fall by 1990. The economist let the ecologist choose specific commodities\". Once again, economist Simon was proved right and Ehrlich wrong. The 1980s were also a decade of prosperity, and raw materials prices generally fell. The ecologist had to pay off on the bet.\nEhrlich’s analytic error was to look only at the demand side, and specifically at a growing world population (more mouths to feed). Julian Simon, with his better economic understanding, also considered the supply side. More people mean more mouths, but also more hands and brains. Simon also took account of other favorable economic trends such as greater liberalization of national economies and increased international trade.\nSo the predictions of economic analysis were vindicated. Nevertheless, Paul Ehrlich continued to publish highly popular books forecasting, as mistakenly as before, environmental doom in the near future. Just as regularly, up to his death in 1998 Julian Simon was providing sound analysis and well-validated economic forecasts, culminating in his volume The Ultimate Resource (2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1998). But none of his books was best-sellers.\nWhat was going on here? An economic interpretation might be that these two authors were supplying different commodities. Julian Simon was supplying correct economic analysis. Paul Ehrlich was and is in a different business, somewhat comparable to horror-story writers such as Stephen King. Evidently, at least when it comes to selling books, the demand for horror stories far exceeds the demand for sound economic analysis. [ For a detailed history of the Ehrlich-Simon wager see John Tierney, “Betting the Planet,” New York Times Magazine, December 2, 1990.]\nA later exhaustive and careful study by the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg (The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001) has updated Simon’s results. Initially intending to refute Simon’s analysis, Lomborg found his research instead of confirming it. Despite the rising world population, per capita incomes have maintained their upward trend and real prices of essential resources have continued to fall.\nAs a rather strange sidelight, upon publishing these results, Lomborg became the target of personal attacks that reached an extraordinary level of intensity. At one of his public presentations, a cream pie was dumped on his face and clothing. He was even accused of “intellectual dishonesty” by a scientific body with official standing in Denmark. Ultimately, all the charges were conclusively refuted, and the improperly motivated proceeding against Lomborg was dismissed. (Which does not necessarily mean, of course, that all of Lomborg’s estimates and forecasts will ultimately prove to be correct.)\nOne possible lesson: sound economic analysis can sometimes be riskier than one might think2\n\nThe material above shows that Ehrlich was not an economist, and facts had refuted his analysis, but his books were still more popular than those by Simon as an economist. Why? Because the demand for Ehrlich’s book is the same as for horror fictions instead of correct economic analysis. Ehrlich kept writing books full of mistakes, not to provide correct economic analysis, but to attract readers as an alarmist. There are similar cases in China too. Who should carry the blames, economics, or some so-called economists?\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that when people enjoy themselves by reading horror fictions, they know that they are just fictions, it will not feel panic. Who would believe that the film of “2012” would become real, and be so horrified to sell out their properties or even commit suicide? But when some economists, with the name of a scientist, are engaged in faking horror fictions, the consequences will be severe. The public thought what they provide were correct economic analysis, but they only make alarmist remarks to earn money. If the government does believe them and implement economic policies according to the analysis of such economists, the consequence will be disastrous.\n\n\n1.

Many readers may believe that those individuals major in economics are easier to find good jobs (and jobs with high incomes), or learn to know how to earn money. In reality, those whose careers are economic-related do have higher incomes, but they are not the richest ones while the richest ones may not be those major in economics or even have never learned economics.\nAs an economics teacher, I hope that the readers would master the way of thinking like an economist as most are not, and will not be economists. They do not need to be economists, but they need to think like economists. \nAs mentioned above, economics is a science, analyzing problems objectively just like natural science. However, natural science only teaches us how to analyze problems about the matter, while economics teaches us how to analyze the problems about human. To learn to think like an economist is to learn to analyze problems objectively, ruling out emotions like anger, as this should be economics most benefit to ordinary people.\nBesides, some economists distort economics analysis for their interests and try to mislead the public and governments to benefit themselves. Therefore, if one has learned economics, he will not be fooled by such economists. Mrs. Robinson, a famous British female economist, once said: “I study economics in order to avoid being deceived by economists.” That is also my Motto.\n"},"Lecture03/":{"url":"Lecture03/","title":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics\nIn the last lecture, we have clarified that economics is a science. Science starts from one or some postulates and axioms, and through logical deduction constructs a theoretical system that can explain facts. Therefore, in this chapter, we are going to introduce the postulate of economics.\n"},"Lecture03/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Self-interest\nThe postulate of economics is \"Self-interest\" or more grandly \"Rationality\".\nThe postulate of Self-interest means that human will try to achieve the best result with the lowest cost. It can be regarded as a biological instinct of animals. Under different circumstances, \"the least cost\" can be equivalent to the lowest price of money spent or the minimal resources consumed, while \"best results\" can be equivalent to the maximal income or revenue.\nCaution: self-interest does not mean to benefit oneself by harming others unless harming others is the least costly way to realize one's self-interest goal. In fact, in most cases, in order to benefit oneself with the least cost, one can better act altruistically. As mentioned in Lecture 1, there is a famous example in the book, Wealth of Nation written by the founder of economics, Adam Smith. It says: the baker bakes bread for his good. He wants to earn money from buyers, but as a result, it also meets their needs. So, subjectively he is doing the job for his good, but objectively he is providing us with food, which benefits himself and others at the same time. He could rob people to get money, but that would put himself in jail. Also, he could beg for money, but few people would be willing to give beggar money for nothing, which means begging would not earn him as much as selling bread. After comparing the costs of the different ways of getting money, he chooses the one with the lowest cost and the highest income, which generally is selling bread. \nOf course, if the place where baker lives had poor public security, robbery would become easier, because the risk of being caught would not be high enough. When committing crime costs less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. Thus, the choice between obeying the law and committing a crime is also the result of selfish-interest by measuring incomes and costs. Actually, beggars are said to have a higher income than bakers; however, not too much people are willing to be beggars, because bakers are more respectable, which means that the so-called income should not narrowly be considered as monetary income, but also contains reputation, dignity, and other non-monetary income. So, incomes include monetary ones and non-monetary. The same applies to costs. If one does not choose to be a beggar, the total incomes of beggar must be not higher than those of baker, and the total costs are not lower, which implies that self-interest dominates his behavior.\nLet us think about this phenomenon more profound. Why do bakers earn more non-monetary incomes than beggars? Due to morality, bakers are respected while beggars are belittled. However, why is morality as such? Because bakers contribute to others and create new wealth by providing bread, while beggars do not contribute to others and create no wealth for society. They transfer wealth from those who donate. In other words, morality guides human to realize self-interest by altruism. That is precisely the reason why human need morality. Morality rewards self-interest acts by altruism, belittles those without benefits to others (such as begging) and condemns those by harming others (such as robbing). Therefore, robbery is not only sanctioned by law but also bears the pressure of moral condemnation which is a non-monetary cost. So morality increases the total costs of robbery. This is the same as the market guiding human to behave altruistically by price and the law preventing them from harming others by penalty.\nTraditional morality makes it shameful to be a beggar, but modern social welfare essentially encourages people to be beggars. The original intention of social welfare is to help the poor, but the real effect is to support the lazy. The reason is straightforward: for one who is not sick or disabled, without the belittling of morality as a non-monetary cost, why not just sit there and live on relief. The national debt crisis of Greece tells this truth: the Greeks are not born to be lazy, and it is the long-term social welfare that makes them so. Also, it corrupts morality which praises self-reliance and belittles idleness. People feel no shame in taking it for granted to ask for money from the government, and scold government no matter it refuses or gives less than before. \n"},"Lecture03/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True","keywords":"","body":"﻿# Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True\nSomeone may argue, “I am not self-interested. It is wrong that economics postulates that one is self-interested.” However, the postulates and axioms of science do not need any proof, which means they do not need to be real or genuine. However, they do need to be tested by facts. It means the theories deduced from them can explain phenomena in reality. If they can’t, the postulates and axioms must be modified or even rejected. Therefore, what can reject the postulate of self-interest is the explanation power of theories deducted from it instead of the truth or correctness of it.\nSome experimental economists try to prove that the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong. However, they make an elementary logical mistake. In Lecture 2 about the methodology of science, it has been pointed out that if “A ⇒ B” is tested, then \"not (B) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. One cannot conclude that “A ⇒ B” is wrong because “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”. Thus it is also seriously wrong to refute economics by experiments which refute the postulate of self-interest or rationality.\nLet us consider this imaginary example to show that even if the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong, it can still explain or predict correctly.1There are a group of people who are going to build gas stations, and there are three places available: the highway, the mountain and the desert. Suppose the construction costs are the same in these three places. According to the postulate of self-interest or rationality, economics predicts that they will build gas stations along the highway. Actually they are idiots, so it is totally wrong to postulate them to be self-interested or rational. Nevertheless, it does not matter! These idiots build gas stations just at random, so some of them build the gas stations in the mountain, while some of them in the desert. Of course, some idiots happen to build the gas stations along the highway. After some time, gas stations in the mountain and dessert go bankrupt because income earned cannot cover operational costs while those along the highway are prosperous and survive more in the business. The final result is the same as economic prediction. That is enough! It is not important whether they choose the place to build the gas stations by careful calculation or at random. It is essential that finally there is no gas station in the mountain or the desert, but there are along the highway, so facts have not refuted the economic prediction.\nMilton Friedman (1912-2006) gave another similar example in his book “Price Theory”. Why do plants grow toward the sun? Biology has a theory to explain this phenomenon. The growth of leaves needs sunlight for photosynthesis, so more leaves are growing in the direction toward the sun and vice versa. As time passes, plants appear to grow toward the sun. Economics can also explain this phenomenon. How? Plants are postulated to be self-interested or rational, and the sunlight is beneficial to their growth, so they grow towards the sun. It is wrong to postulate plants to be self-interested or rational. How can plants think? It does not matter. The conclusion of economic explanation can be the same as that of biological explanation.\nThere is a new inter-discipline called bio-economics which uses the postulate of economics to deduce the theories explaining the biological phenomena. Moreover, the biological study also supports the postulate of economics. There is a famous book “The Extended Selfish Gene” in biology. It is well-known that species evolve through genetic mutations. Some mutations conform to the nature of selfishness, while some do not. Those genes without the nature of selfishness will be eliminated in natural selection, while those who are selfish survive. The survivors keep duplicating their genes and multiply, which makes selfishness continuously strengthened and inherited, thus ultimately determines that all species, including human, are selfish. Isn’t this process similar to the example of building gas stations by the idiots? Genetic mutations are random, just like the choices of the idiots. Nevertheless, natural selection determines that only the gas stations or genes conforming to the nature of selfishness can survive. It is well-known that Darwin’s idea is natural selection or survival of the fittest, but few know that the exposition inspired him about the self-interest of human in Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”.\nHowever, it is not crucial whether a human is self-interested or not, or whether he is selfish due to the genes as “The Extended Selfish Gene” suggests, because self-interest is a postulate which does not need to be proved but must be accepted. If one does not accept it, then it is better not to study economics. Of course, one can invent a subject with the postulate of un-self-interest. Those who study this subject must accept it, but the theories deducted from it need to be tested by facts. If facts do not refute the theories, one will succeed in establishing a brand-new subject called Economics of Un-self-interest, while the economics now may be renamed as Economics of Self-interest. However, if facts refute one's theories, he has to modify or even abandon the postulate of un-self-interest. No one has been able to do so, because the theories deducted from the postulate of un-self-interest are easily refuted by facts and cannot be established as a subject.\nIn geometry, however, it did happen that new subjects were established by changing postulates. The geometry learned in middle school is “Euclidean geometry” because ancient Greek Euclid established it. There are five postulates in Euclidean geometry. Among them, the axiom derived from the fifth postulate is called “the parallel axiom” that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one”. However, in the 19th century, a Russian adopted a contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, at least two new lines can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” As a result, a new set of geometry theories without logical contradiction within it was deduced based on this new axiom. Later on, another German also deduced another set of new geometry theories without logical contradiction within it based on another contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, no new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” Eventually, the geometry based on the parallel axiom is called Euclidean geometry, while those based on alternative axioms other than the parallel one are collectively called non-Euclidean geometries.\nScience is like this: In the first stage, there are one or several postulates which need not be proved, nor need it be true or real, but all in this discipline must accept and abide by the postulates. Anyone can establish new subjects based on different postulates, but whether they are successfully established must be tested by facts.\n\n\n1. This imaginary example is adapted from “The Science of Demand”, the 1st volume of the 1st edition of “Economic Explanation” by Steven N. S. Cheung, The Arcadia Press, May 2001, P44. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed\nSince economics has postulated human to be self-interested, it can not postulate human to be un-self-interested at the same time. In other words, one can not explain human behaviours with un-self-interest, or there can not be cases of un-self-interest. It is the same as Geometry: there can not be any theories that are contradictory to the parallel axiom in Euclidean Geometry. It is also the same as laws. The constitution is the fundamental law of a nation just like postulates and axioms of science. There can not be any laws that are contradictory to the constitution, or else they must be amended or even abolished.\nWhat would happen if economics postulated human to be both self-interested and un-self-interested at the same time? If it was the case, then economics could be able to explain any phenomena, but actually, economics had not been able to explain it all.\nFor instance, why does one cheat others for money: It is because he is self-interested. Moreover, why does one donate money to others? Because he is un-self-interested.\nEconomics seems to have explained both the behaviors, but neither has been explained. When would on earth one be self-interested, and when would he be un-self-interested? How to predict if one would cheat or donate money in advance? As mentioned before, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, theories are more needed to help to predict the future. If human were postulated to be both self-interested and un-self-interested, it would be impossible to predict their behaviors and be impossible to explain when they will cheat or donate money. This scenario brings out the specific case of tautology.\nHowever, it would also be false to answer like that: why does one cheat others of money? Is it because he is self-interested, or why does one donate money to others? Is it because he is un-self-interested?\nSelf-interest is a postulate which can not apply directly to explain phenomena; otherwise, the explanations with it are directly postulated. It would happen again that any phenomena could be explained, but actually, they had not been explained at all, which is also the case of tautology. This scenario shows how it is easy to make the mistakes of tautology!\nIt is relatively easy to explain why one chooses to cheat. As mentioned before, when committing a crime was costing less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. The explanations for both phenomena are similar. If cheating is an easy way of getting money, and would not be caught by the police, one would tend to do so.\nHow about donating? If the donatee is a rich kid and he can go to school even without donations, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the donatee is a poor kid and he cannot go to school without donations, one would tend to donate to him.\nFurthermore, if the poor kid has no intention of study and donations would not make him study well, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the kid has the passion and intelligence to study and just lack of money, one would tend to donate to him.\nStill, furthermore, suppose there is a charity and one needs to go a few miles to donate, one would tend to do so. In contrast, if one has to drive or take a car to the backwaters thousands of miles away to donate directly, he would not take such trouble. If there is a severe charity scandal exposed, one finds out that his donations have been abused instead of helping the poor, he would not tend to donate again.1\nThe effect of a charity scandal on donations can be used to demonstrate the methodology of science introduced in the previous lecture. Suppose there are three kinds of economics: Economics of Self-interest, Economics of Un-self-interest, and Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. A charity scandal will be used to test which of them is scientifically valid.\nAccording to the postulate of Economics of Self-interest, if there are scandals, then donations to charity will decline, but if they increase, then Economics of Self-interest is refuted. This situation can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. Donations do drop dramatically after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is scientifically true.\nIn contrast, according to the postulate of Economics of Un-self-interest, donations to the charity will increase due to scandals, but if they decline, Economics of Un-self-interest is refuted. It can present the refutable condition, so it is scientific. However, the donations drop after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is a scientific fault. It is too easy to refute Economics of Un-self-interest by facts; no wonder no one has ever tried to establish such economics.\nHow about Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest? Can it represent the refutable condition? No way! If the donations to the charity decline, it will say because human is self-interested now; while if they increase, it will say because human is un-self-interested now. It is always true, no matter what happens. However, precisely due to its irrefutability, it is a tautology instead of a science. One may doubt if there would be such ridiculous economics. Of course, there is, but with higher-sounding names. Earlier there was a concept of \"bounded rationality\" that prevailed for a while, and the idea of \"irrationality\" has been alive until now. Besides, there is \"behavioral economics\" which is rather popular and hot at present. The nature of all above is Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. There are full of such non-scientific concepts and ideas in mainstream economics; no wonder it is despised by natural scientists.\nIn short, although donating is a kind of philanthropy which seems to be contrary to the postulate of self-interest, in fact, it is dominated by self-interest. Self-interest means that people will try to achieve the best results with the least cost. When one wants to help others, he still wants to achieve the best result for this goal with the least cost. So it is better to donate to poor kids rather than to rich ones. It is better to donate to the hard-working kids other than to those without the intention of studying. Moreover, it costs less to distribute the donations by a reputable charity. However, if the charity is not reliable at all, it is better to send directly to the donatees by oneself. Thus, the fact that human is altruistic has not refuted the postulate of self-interest. Because even if altruism is the result one wants to achieve, he still wants to achieve it with the least cost, which means that self-interest still dominates his behaviors.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain donating, but we can show how self-interest dominates the choices of a donator under different constraints. \"Constraint\" is a fundamental concept in economics, meaning the objective restriction on human's behaviors. Self-interest is also a restriction on human behaviors, but it is a postulate, needs not to be true and not an objective fact, while constraint must be.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain human behaviors in economics. Instead, we need to point out different constraints and predict what a self-interested person will do under such constraints. This is both a prediction and an explanation. Finally, we need to investigate whether the person does do so as we predict. If he does, that means facts have tested the postulate of self-interest; otherwise, it has been refuted.\nNeither can the postulate of self-interest directly apply to explain robbery or cheating. Different constraints are: one is that the police are powerful, and robbers and cheaters will be caught and punished. Under such a constraint, self-interested people will not choose to commit crimes. The other is the opposite situation, and it is more profitable to commit a crime.\nIn conclusion, there are different choices or behaviors of human not because human are sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because of different constraints. We can not apply economics to explain what has happened or predict what will happen by changing the postulate of self-interest, but investigating the change of constraints. \n\n\n1. Some may argue that there is a trick with the concept of donation in the explanation. Upon donating, the question is why one chooses to donate? Rather than why one chooses to donate to a poor and hard-working kid after he had chosen to donate. Indeed, there are two aspects of questions about donation. Firstly, why does one choose to donate, or why does one not keep the money for his use? Secondly, having chosen to donate, how does one choose to donate with the least costs and best result. The explanation here is the answer to the second question. The first question has been answered when it is discussed why human needs morality in the first section of this lecture. More specifically, suppose there are two persons in a society, and one is poor while the other is rich. If there were no morality, the rich one would only think about himself, while the poor one would die of starvation. Then only the rich will survive, but the question is how long he could survive in competition with other animals after he is alone in the society? However, if there is morality, the rich would donate his surplus to the poor one who would not die of starvation, and thus the competition with other animals will be minimal, and a chance for survival will be higher in comparison to if he was left alone.This example shows that morality is precisely the result of selfish-interest of all human beings as a whole who tries to maximize the chances of survival in competitions with other species. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness\nIn Mainstream Economics or textbooks, there are often mistakes of being a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, because there are so many theories about \"irrationality\". For instance, it is said that there is irrational exuberance when the stock market is rising too much. As mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, the meaning of self-interest and rationality is the same. If one is said to be irrational, it means he is un-self-interested, which is a conflict with the postulate of economics, so it is a serious mistake. Some economists would be cautious about saying that it is difficult to judge how much the stock index could be regarded as irrationality. However, it is not the problem of how to judge if the stock index is irrational or not. It is forbidden in economics to use irrationality to explain human behaviors, which is the same as it is forbidden in non-Euclidean geometry to use the parallel axiom.\nNo matter how crazily the price of a stock rises, it is rational. That sounds too ridiculous to accept. Nevertheless, the critical point is: that human is self-interested or rational does not mean they are sure to make correct choices. The crazily rising of a stock price is the result of the investors' rational choices which may not be correct. Are rational or self-interested choices correct? Regardless of the cases mentioned before that committing crimes is rational but morally wrong behavior, here is another case. One is rational to make a choice, which means he believes he can achieve the best result with the lowest cost, but he may find he is wrong in the end. In other words, he has not achieved the best result or paid a higher price.\nTake the stock investment as an example. One must believe the price of the stock he is going to buy would rise. However, the price of the stock may fall after he bought, so he suffered a loss. Was he irrational? No, he only made a mistake in his expectation of the stock price.\nMoreover, why did he make a mistake? Because he is not the omniscient God! He thought that the stock price would rise, but it falls eventually. If he could know the price would fall in advance, of course, he would not choose to buy the stock. It is not because he is irrational, but because he does not know! If he knew the price would fall in advance, but he still chose to buy the stock, then the postulate of rationality would have been refuted by facts. That has never happened.\nHuman is rational, but he is not omniscient, which means ignorance is a constraint. Some have reliable inside information of the stock market, and know more than others or are less constrained, so their choices are more correct than those who are relatively ignorant. They are not more rational than others, but just under a different constraint. It is always the difference of constraints rather than rationality or irrationality that causes different human behaviors and their results.\nLet us consider another example in reality for illustration. A student of economics posted in an economic forum that a classmate of his had not been going to take the postgraduate entrance examination. However, later he heard that someone not as good as he had passed the examination, so he completely changed his decision. The poster felt doubt that his classmate changed his decision just due to hearing such a piece of news. Is it right for economics to postulate human to be rational?\nHas it refuted the postulate of rationality? Of course not. The classmate was not going to take the postgraduate entrance examination, of which he must have estimated the cost and benefit. He had to choose to spend time preparing for the exam or job hunting. Once he failed in the exam, neither had a job, he would suffer a significant loss. In the beginning, he estimated the exam to be very difficult. It must be because of the information he had that made him believe that he had little chance to pass. He rationally gave up the exam after the calculation the cost and benefit. Later, he got some new information that someone not as good as he had passed the exam, so he adjusted his estimation about the exam, which means the constraints have changed. Thanks to the new information, he now knows better about the difficulty of the exam or becomes less ignorant than he was before. Along with the change of constraints, his choice or behavior also changed. If he knew that a postgraduate degree was better than a graduate job and he could pass the exam, but he still did not change his choice, then we would have arrived in conclusion that postulate of rationality has been refuted. Remember: it is always the change of constraints other than the postulate of self-interest or rationality that can be used to explain human's behaviors.\nSome economists suggest that the reasons why self-interested or rational people cannot make correct choices are divided into ignorance and uncertainty. However, they are the same because uncertainty means it is impossible to completely know the future, which is equivalent to the ignorance of the future.\nIgnorance is also a constraint which is defined as transaction cost in economics. Transaction cost is a fundamental but complicated concept, so it will not be explained in detail until the later lecture in this book. However, this concept is so indispensable that we need to frequently apply it to almost every issue of economics before that lecture. A reader can take his time to comprehend it by observing how it is applied.\nOne kind of transaction costs is information cost which is the cost of acquiring information. Ignorance is precisely due to information cost. One would choose to be ignorant rationally when there is too high information cost. Ignorance is a rational choice! One can benefit from knowing more, for which he has to pay formation cost. If the information cost is higher than the benefit, it is not worth knowing more, so it is rational to choose to be ignorant. When one becomes more enlightened, he is constrained less by information cost.\nAs mentioned above, uncertainty is the ignorance of the future. Human has made great efforts to predict the future, including weather prediction, earthquake prediction and even such unscientific means as fortune-telling. Great efforts imply tremendous information costs. To sum up, information cost is one kind of transaction costs, and transaction cost is a significant constraint that would affect human's behaviors. \n"},"Lecture03/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest\nEconomics postulates human to be self-interested. It does not matter whether it is true or false. What does matter is facts have not rejected the results deduced from it. If the government does not take this postulate into account, or even just not carefully enough, there would be unexpected effects of policy implementation which would even run counter to the original intentions. For example, social welfare is intended to help the poor and the weak, but it makes them lazy and even corrupts morality. There are such counterproductive policies everywhere in reality. The policy-makers should be cautious: do not just think that the original intentions are good, but try to have a guess what the self-interested people would respond with a countermeasure.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: RATIONAL DRIVERS?1\nAir-bags reduce, on average, the severity of auto injuries and the risk of death from motor accidents. However, given that additional safety margin, it might well be rational for motorists to drive more aggressively!\nIs such an adaptation observed? Steven Peterson, George Hoffer, and Edward Millner examined statistics collected by the state of Virginia about fatal two-car accidents in 1993.   In 30 such accidents, one car was equipped with an air-bag, and the other was not. The accident reports identified in each case the supposed \"initiator\" the party was driving more aggressively. The table indicates that in 22 of the 30 accidents (73%) the initiators drove cars with air-bags, although only 50% of the cars involved in accidents were air-bag equipped. So, the indications are, having an air-bag increased the likelihood of a driver to initiate an accident.\nTwo-car accidents with/without air-bags (Virginia, 1993)\n\n\n\n\nWith air-bags\nWithout air-bags\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cars\n30 (50%)\n30 (50%)\n\n\nNumber of \"initiators\"\n22 (73%)\n8 (27%)\n\n\n\nSource: Adapted from Peterson et >al., p. 262.\nAny single bit of evidence such as this can only be indicative, not conclusive. Moreover, even if entirely valid, these results do not necessarily imply that regulations requiring air-bags are inadvisable. Although drivers of airbag-equipped vehicles may indeed be more inclined to take risks, the increased aggressiveness may not entirely cancel out the overall beneficial safety effect of air-bags.\n\nThis reading material illustrates that air-bags are equipped to reduce the damage of accidents, the intention of which is good. However, the result is out of expectation. Because of the reduction of the damage of a car accident, drivers become aggressive in driving. Under the constraint of the cars equipped with air-bags, the costs of aggressive driving decrease from severe disability or even death to minor injury or disability. As a result, drivers tend to drive faster. The risk of severe damage caused by a car accident is reduced, while that of the happening of car accidents increases. So the number of victims of accidents may increase. The result is uncertain for drivers, but for pedestrians without air-bags on their backs, they are sure to be harmed. Then for the whole society, air-bags equipped in cars may do more harm than good.\nIn order to eliminate crimes, some have suggested a death penalty to be imposed on all crimes regardless of their severities. However, once the severity of the penalty was out of line with that of crime, the costs and benefits faced by a criminal would be distorted, and he would make distorted choices. Just imagine what would happen if a nation did do so. The criminal rate would certainly plunge, and minor offences such as stealing would almost disappear, but serious crimes such as murder would increase. Why? Suppose now one was out of money and with no option but to steal or rob. Meanwhile, the police's detection rate cannot be 100%. In other words, one might not be caught and punished. So what kind of crimes would one opt to commit? Will one opt for petty stealing or robbing a bank? The consequences of being caught in both cases would be the same: death penalty. The same costs with different revenues, what would one choose? The answer is obvious. The legislation should base on objective analysis instead of passion, or else there would be horrible consequences. No nation has implemented such a death penalty, which implies it is unfit to survive.\n\n\n1.

However, we cannot directly use the postulate to explain phenomena, but show how self-interest manipulates people to make different choices under different constraints. There are various kinds of constraints, and in this lecture, we will start with a crucial constraint: scarcity.\n"},"Lecture04/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Scarcity","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Scarcity\nScarcity means that compared to people’s desire, the goods they want are not enough. Scarcity is an essential constraint because if there were no scarcity, people would not have to make any choice even if they are self-interested. Just imagine that everything we want was unlimitedly satisfying. Thus no matter how self- interested we are, we would always get all of them. So why should we bother to make any choice anymore? However, goods are scarce, and we have to give up something in order to get other things else, so self-interest matters much in carefully calculating how to obtain goods at the lowest price.\nIn economics, anything of which available is preferred to non-available is defined as a “good” regardless of whether it is a tangible commodity or intangible service, or spiritual enjoyment (including feelings). Some economics textbooks define a “bad” as anything of which non-available is preferred to available, such as garbage and noise. However, with proper redefinition, all “bads” can be converted to “goods”, such as garbage to “cleaning up garbage”. Thus it is not necessary to analyze “bads,” and only “goods” are enough.\nIf anything of which not only available is preferred to non-available, but also more is preferred to less, it is defined as an “economic good”. That means it is scarce, so anyone who wants to obtain it must pay a cost or a price if it is in the market. If anything of which available is preferred to non-available, but more is not preferred to less, it is a “free good” which means it is not scarce and takes no cost.\nWe have to be cautious of what is called “free” in daily life as it often means no need to pay the price in the market, which is not the same as taking no cost. So what is free in the market may not be a free good. For instance, public space is free to enter, but of which more is preferred to less, and is not a free good.\nSo what is a free good? Let’s take the air as an example. In the place where the air is fresh and clean, of air available is preferred to non-available. Even indispensable, but because it is so abundant that no one will pay a cost for more of it, the air is herein a free good. However, in a big city where the air is often impure, fresh and clean air becomes scarce. People are willing to pay a cost for more fresh and clean air, such as buying air purifiers, paying higher prices for houses with better greening. Air herein becomes an economic good. For underwater workers, the air is so scarce that they will pay a rather high price to buy bottled oxygen. Goods are almost economic goods, while free goods are rare and only exist under certain conditions, which means scarcity is ubiquitous.\nSome may envision a future society with extreme material abundance. Can it be a society without scarcity where the distribution of goods could be according to people’s want? Let alone whether or not a society in the future can genuinely achieve such extreme material abundance that the supply of some goods is unlimited relative to human’s need, even if this could be true, would there be no scarcity?\nIn colleges, there are always empty seats in classrooms, because number of seats is higher than that of students. Since one student can only take one seat at a time, the supply of seats is unlimited relative to their needs. However, is there no scarcity for seats? Why are more front-row seats occupied while back-row ones mostly left empty? The key is the different qualities of seats! The front-row seats are good, while the back-row seats are bad ones. Thus, although the seats outnumber the students in the classroom, the good ones are still less than the students, so they are still scarce! The so-called good and bad emerge from comparison, so no matter how many seats there are in the classroom, there is only one seat that is the best. Otherwise, how can it be called “the best”? Similarly, there is also only one seat that is the second-best, and the same to the third, the fourth…best. There is always scarcity!\nSo this is the key to scarcity: if there is no quality difference among goods, increasing the number of goods can eliminate scarcity. However, the difference in the quality of goods leads to scarcity, even if the quantity of goods far exceeds the want.\nThus, in order to realize the ideal society without scarcity, we need not only extreme material abundance but also eliminate all the quality difference - including the quality difference among human beings. It is a pity that God created human being unfairly. Some persons, e.g. Einstein, are born with higher IQs. Maybe in that ideal society, a person would take an IQ test as he/she is just born, and if his/her IQ were higher than a “standard man,” some surgery would be needed to eliminate the higher part of IQ. Also, those whose physical quality is superior, such as sports stars, would need elimination operations. The question is, who would wish to live in such a “Brave New World”?\nGod created human being both fairly and unfairly. The unfairness has been talked about, while the fairness lies in the fact that no matter how mediocre in many aspects, one can always find a specific aspect superior to others. However, it may not be necessarily useful in the market, so it does not have a price. That is why most people are mediocre. If all the quality differences were to be eliminated, not only Einstein or sports stars would have to undertake the operation, but all of us would do so to eliminate every aspect of quality difference according to a “standard man.”\n"},"Lecture04/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Competition, Competition Criterion, and Game rule","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Competition, Competition Criterion, and Game rule\nHuman is self-interested, and the goods he wants is scarce, so there is naturally fight for the goods. Competition means self-interested people fight for scarce goods. There is always competition, as long as there are self-interest and scarcity.1 The following lectures will talk about the market structure, including free competition and monopoly. However, do not misunderstand that only in the free competition market there is competition while there is not in the monopoly market. There is still competition in the monopoly market, just in another form. So it is totally wrong that economics textbooks or some economists boast about the lack of competition.\nIn any competition, winners must be selected out of players, but how? Competition in sports is the most obvious one that people can experience, so let us take it as an example. For instance, in a running race, there is a standard or criterion of “speed” to select out the winner: the fastest runner wins, and slow ones lose. In order to make sure that the winner will be the fastest runner, there are a bunch of rules in the game. Such as all players should start from the same line and kick-off at the same time, and drugs are prohibited. Just imagine that if jumping the gun were allowed, the first person crossing the finishing line might not be the one who runs fastest. So the rules of the game are designed to establish the criterion of competition.\nLet us generalize the above analysis. Suppose now we go to a grand theatre to enjoy an idol singer’s concert instead of taking a lecture in a college classroom. Surely there are more seats in the grand theatre than in the college classroom, but there are even much more people like to enjoy the concert. It is obvious that there is scarcity, so competition is inevitable. How to decide who wins and who loses? How to decide who can get those seats at the concert? For many, the first part of this question may not be easy to answer, but the latter part is rather easy, so almost everyone can answer without thinking, “Tickets for sale!” Bingo! This is precisely the criterion for deciding wins or loses: Price! Whoever is willing to pay the price of the ticket will get the designated seat, while whoever is unwilling will not get one. The essence of using price to decide the winners of the competition is the distribution of scarce goods by a price, which is commonly known as the market economy! In other words, the market economy is the price criterion for competition.\nHowever, in reality, there are many other criteria other than the price criterion for competition.\nTake the example of seats in college classroom mentioned above. Although the good seats are still scarce, they are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis instead of paying a price. The early birds occupy the better seat, while the later ones have to sit in back-row. Moreover, the seats may also be allocated by a teacher who has the right to decide which students can sit where, which is the case in elementary and secondary schools. The seats may also be allocated by age or longevity, which is precisely the hierarchical system of seniority. This kind of allocation for seats is prevalent at the meetings of government. The seats may also be allocated by voting, where who gets the most votes can take the best seat. This is so-called democracy. \nLast but not least, the seats may also be allocated by force. Although one may arrive first and occupy the best seat, if the latter student is much taller and stronger, and by waving his fist, one may be threatened to give up the best seat to him. This is so-called “the law of the jungle,” which is the law of nature, and rules not only human society but also the whole nature.\nCriteria like these are countless, all of which are named as “non-pricing criteria” in economics because they all do not use price as the competition criterion.\nWhy does economics single out the price criterion and leave all other criteria to another category? Because among all the competition criteria, price criterion is the only one that does not lead to the so-called “waste.” The word “waste” is not entirely correct, so should be revised to the more strict term “rent dissipation” which is rather complicated, so will be explained in later lectures in detail. Whereas “waste” is commonly known and easy to understand, so it is used here to express the meaning of “rent dissipation” for the time being.\nWhy does price criterion not cause waste? Because with price criterion, those who want to obtain the scarce goods must pay a price, i.e. paying money. On the one hand, the money the buyers pay becomes the seller’s income, which means the money does not disappear in vain from the view of the whole society. On the other hand, where does the money paid by buyers come from? It comes from selling something needed by others in the market. That is to say, in order to satisfy his self-interest, one must benefit others first, to get money to take part in the competition. The more one contributes to others or the society, the more money he gets, and the higher the chance of winning the competition with price criterion. In the last lecture, it is mentioned that self-interest does not necessarily mean harming others, and, in many cases, altruism is the best way to self-interest. The market is precisely a system that guides the self-interested human to benefit others. From the above analysis, we can further understand how the market economy decides winners or losers by price criterion and guides the self-interested human to benefit others first in order to win in a competition.\nSomeone might doubt: if it is the price criterion that decides winners or losers, wouldn’t the rich always win? Firstly, with this competition criterion, the rich are indeed in a more favorable position, and that is exactly why people are motivated to seek more income by benefiting others and creating more wealth for society.\nSecondly, even with the price criterion, the rich are just more capable of paying a high price than the poor. It means that they are less limited by the constraint of wealth, but not necessarily more willing to do so. Take the above pop star concert as an example. Let us assume the singer is an idol of the young who are willing to pay hundreds of RMB to buy tickets of the concert, while others are not attracted. The older persons who have worked for years are generally richer than most of the young, but will usually not pay, although they can afford the price. So, in the competition for tickets, the young though poor win, the old though rich lose. If the price of a ticket were low enough, such as a few dozens or even tens of RMB, the old might also be willing to pay. Nevertheless, when the price is too high - higher than what they think to be worth, they will not buy. Similarly, few people will buy high-grade fruit for dozens or even hundreds of RMB. Can’t they afford it? Impossible! Even the young who have not worked can afford hundreds of RMB to buy concert tickets for their idol. How come the old cannot afford the high-grade fruit? It is not that they cannot afford, but that they do not think it is worth the price, so will not buy.\nSomeone might also doubt: may the money people use to bid for goods necessarily come from their previous contributions to society? Maybe they get the money by stealing, robbing or cheating. First of all, in the last lecture, it has been analyzed in details that as long as there are effective laws to punish the crime of robbing, stealing, and cheating, a self-interested human will choose to get money by contributing to society, instead of by harming others. Morality will also condemn such harmful behaviors to increase the non-monetary costs. Secondly, as mentioned above, the criterion to decide winners or losers needs a bunch of game rules to establish it. These laws and morality are exactly the game rules that establish the price criterion!\nIf a person competes for scarce goods with the money by robbing, is it different from those who win a running race by jumping the gun or doping sneakily? Without the laws that effectively punish those who get money by harming others, a self-interested human will choose to harm instead of benefiting others. It is just as that if the game rules of running race do not forbid jumping the gun, self-interested runners will choose to try to train the technique of jumping the gun instead of reacting quickly to it.\nFurthermore, if robbing is legal, the muggers can not only rob the money for bidding goods but also the goods themselves without paying any price at all. In this extreme circumstance, the price criterion for deciding winners or losers has fallen apart entirely.\nIn the later lectures, we will explain the legal system to establish the price criterion (i.e. the market economy). It is the system of protecting private property rights or PPRs - the law forbids robbing since it infringes the victim’s PPRs. The PPR is a very complex concept which will be explained in the later lectures. As a short introduction: PPRs include use right, the right to income, and the right to transfer. The legal system of protecting PPRs is the cornerstone of the market economy. It is just empty talk if we only talk about the market economy as a competition criterion without legal system as the game rule.\nIt is said that the market economy should be divided into a good one and bad one. The market economy in developed countries is a good one, while that in the vast majority of developing countries is a bad one although most of them are not socialist countries practicing planned economy. It is implied that in developed countries, the market economy is supported by the rule of law; while in developing countries, there is no rule of law, so they are overwhelmed by bureaucratic corruptions. There are also other different descriptions, such as “crony capitalism”. All of these are a severe misunderstanding about the market economy! Without an effective legal system as the cornerstone, there is impossible to be a market economy, because it is not the price criterion but other non-price criteria such as force and power that decide winners or losers of competitions. How can a running race that allows jumping the gun and doping be recognized as a normal one? So, the market economy is not divided into a good one and bad one, but rather into a true one and fake one!\n\n\n1. Strictly speaking, the condition of “society” must be added, and along with self-interest and scarcity can lead to competition. In a one-man world, no matter how self-interested a person is, he just needs to compete with nature and animals. However, economics as a social science is not concerned with this kind of competition. Economics focus on the competition among humans which only exist in society. The concept of “society” will be defined in the lecture of “transaction costs”. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture04/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Choice of Competition Criteria\nAs mentioned above, there is no so-called waste with price criterion to decide winners or losers of competition. However, other non-price criteria will undoubtedly result in waste more or less. For example, first-come-first-served will cause queuing. One stands in line with nothing else to do, and he has paid the cost of time - a kind of opportunity cost that will be explained in the later lecture about costs. While no one gets any benefit from his waiting, so he contributes nothing to society. That is why it is a waste. In contrast, if he pays the price directly, the seller will get the money which comes from the buyer’s previous contributions to society.\nIf it is up to the teacher to decide who gets the best seats, students will try to flatter the teacher, such as licking the shoes or even giving packets of money, which is equivalent to paying the price to the teacher. However, this kind of bribery is prohibited by law. The process of law enforcement (including reporting, filing, taking evidence, trial, and judgment, etc.) involves huge costs and is wasteful. If law enforcement is not strict, teachers will be careless in teaching but obsessed with how to collect packets of money from students skillfully.\nIf it is seniority that determines who can get good seats, obviously self-interested human will choose to do nothing but wait for getting older, which cause a waste similar to waiting in line. In state-owned enterprises where seniority prevails, there are significantly more “old dogs”, which is precisely one of the main reasons for the inefficiency there.\nIf the allocation of seats is decided by democratic voting, people will form pressure groups to lobby for votes. In the later lecture of “Political Economics,” we will explain why it is wasteful, and show that voting on specific issues will result in an infringement of PPRs.\nIf it is the law of the jungle that prevails, a human will keep strong and spend money on weapons. It is good to be strong, but if it is for harming others, instead of producing or creating more wealth, it is again a waste. Not to mention the weapons are made for massacre.\nIn conclusion, all non-price criteria of competition are bound to be more or less wasteful, which should be called “rent dissipation” in economic. Rent dissipation is a kind of transaction cost which will be talked about in details in the later lectures of “Transaction Cost” and “Rent Dissipation”.\nAs a smart reader, one might point out: since human is self-interested, and price criterion does not cause rent dissipation, while the non-price criterion surely does, self-interested human should only choose price criterion and never choose any non-price criteria. But this conclusion is obviously not consistent with the fact (i.e., rejected by the fact). The answer is: although price criterion does not cause so-called waste, the market transaction will cause transaction costs, which shall be explained in the later lecture of “Transaction Cost”. Also, in order to establish price criterion, there must be an effective legal system to protect PPRs as the game rule whose establishment and operation will also cost a lot, and it is also a kind of transaction cost. Again, the detailed explanation will be in the lecture of “Transaction Cost”, and here is only the brief main point. The cost of price criterion or market transaction is the transaction cost in a narrow sense, while the cost of the legal system is that in a broad sense.\nTherefore, if price is chosen as competition criterion, there will be transaction cost, while if a non-price criterion is chosen, there will be rent dissipation which is also a kind of transaction cost. So, which will be chosen: price criterion or non-price one? The answer depends on the constraints in a specific circumstance. Under different constraints, the transaction costs involved in price criterion and non-price criterion will vary. Of course, self-interested human will choose the one that causes the least transaction cost.\nThus, the postulate of self-interest dominates all economic theories, and along with different constraints, determines all explanations of human behaviors.\nThe name “economics” is in fact somewhat misleading. A layperson would think that economics can only explain the human behaviors in the economic field. However, it is far beyond that field. The behavior of human choice, in the economic or other fields, can be explained by economics. This book has taken numerous examples to illustrate economic explanation which are not limited in the economic field but also involves other fields such as law, political science, history, sociology, and anthropology. From this perspective, the more accurate name for this discipline should be “Science of Human Behaviors”. Some call this as “economics imperialism” which means “invasion” into other fields of discipline by using the logic of economics. More appropriately, economics is the whole of social science, instead of just a part of it. Because social science is the study of human beings, and no social sciences other than economics has found suitable postulates, and base on them to construct a theoretical framework which is logically self-consistent and stand up facts test (i.e., “refutable”). Therefore, only based on the postulate of economics can other social sciences be regarded as “science”, which means they are part of economics, just the applications of economics in different fields.\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the last lecture, there is an interdisciplinary “biological economics” nowadays, which extends the postulate of economics to natural sciences. By assuming non-human organisms (such as plants, or even genes) are self-interested, it explains some biological phenomena. Thus, in the broadest sense, economics is the science that can explain all of the following phenomena: by assuming the subjects (human or non-human) are self-interested, regard all phenomena of the subjects as their choice with purpose under certain constraints.\n"},"Lecture05/":{"url":"Lecture05/","title":"Lecture 5: Positive Economics and Normative Economics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 5: Positive Economics and Normative Economics\nThe previous lectures expound that economics is a social science, like physics and other natural sciences, which logically derive a theoretical system based on some postulates and axioms to explain various phenomena in reality. However, as mentioned in Lecture 2, the subject of economics is human, while that of physics is nonliving matter. So economics is severely affected by an economist who himself is also human, and the incompetent or ill-intentioned ones of them often distort the research deliberately or unconsciously and let their personal feelings or even interests interfere with scientific study.\nHow can economists avoid distorting economic analysis with personal feelings or interests? Moreover, how can the ordinary learn to think like economists even when they do not need to become economist, and free from the delusion by the economists’ intentional or unintentional misanalysis? Answer: we should distinguish clearly between positive economics and normative economics.\n"},"Lecture05/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section01.html","title":"Section1: Positive economics","keywords":"","body":"Section1: Positive economics\nPositive economics or “empirical analysis” argues that economic theories are used to explain the phenomena, and answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. Based on the postulate of self-interest, along with the constraints changes, economics explains various kinds of human behaviors. Economics is not responsible for answering such questions as “Is self-interest good?”, “Should human be self-interested?” or “should a person make such a choice?”\nAs mentioned in Lecture 2, if there is a one-hundred-dollar bill on the ground, it will be blown away by the wind if there is so, which is a phenomenon that can be explained by physics. However, the bill will still disappear in the absence of wind, which is a phenomenon that physics cannot explain, but economics can. The economic explanation for it is: because human is self-interested, if there is no watching over or surveillance camera, which is the constraint, it is sure that someone will take away the bill. Economics is only responsible for answering why someone will take the bill away, but not answering whether he should take it away. Physics is also only responsible for answering why the bill will disappear when there is wind, but not answering whether the wind should blow it away. However, because physics deals with nonliving matter such as wind, physicists are hardly criticized for not answering the latter question. Whereas because economics deals with human behavior, economists are often criticized harshly for not answering such question as to whether particular human behavior is good or bad, which is even blamed bitterly as immoral!\nImagine that someone threw garbage out of a high-rise building and injured a passer-by. Newton came to answer why the garbage fell to the ground instead of flying up to the sky after leaving human’s hand. Smith came to answer why the man threw the garbage out of the building instead of putting it in a trash can. A moralist came to answer whether the man should throw the garbage out of the building.\nAn economist does not talk about morality, which does not mean he is immoral. As an economist, when he analyzes human behaviors with economic theories, he only needs to answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. It is morality that is responsible for answering the latter question. It is just the division for different disciplines. Asking an economist to answer whether particular human behavior is good or bad is like asking Newton whether an apple should fall to the ground. To criticize an economist coming to a conclusion you do not like is as ridiculous as to blame an apple which fell from a tree and injured a passer-by, “Damn it! What a bad apple! How can it fell exactly when someone is passing by?”\n"},"Lecture05/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Normative economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Normative economics\nHowever, government always asks economists questions of “ought to be”, such as how should government solve an economic problem, or whether a policy is good or bad and whether it should implement or not……So how should economists do?\nTo answer these questions, economists should answer the question of “to be”, that is, analyze empirically at first. Take the case of car airbag in Lecture 3 for example. Government might ask economists: “Should be a policy of stipulating all cars to have airbags implemented?” Economists should conduct objective scientific analysis with economics at first, pointing out that because of the self-interested nature of human, with airbags on cars, drivers will drive more recklessly, which lead to more car accidents and casualties. Then economists do not need to say anything more, and government would naturally know how to do. If what government wants are fewer car accidents and casualties, given the economists’ analysis, it is clear that a mandatory stipulation of car airbags can not hit the target.\nOf course, it is also possible that government has colluded with airbag manufacturers, so what it wants is to force everyone to buy airbags. Obviously it is improper for the airbag manufacturers to openly claim that they push government to implement a policy for their interest, so they come up with a seemingly plausible and grandiose reason. Government explains that airbags can help to reduce casualties when a car accident happens, so they are good for drivers. If the objective and neutral economists present the correct economic analysis mentioned above, the self-interested airbag manufacturers will often deliberately incite the resentments of the public, cause confusions in the argument, and attack the economists for not caring about drivers’ life as immoral. The ignorant public cannot objectively analyze the truth, so are easy to cheat. Some of them are drivers, and they wrongly believe that the agents of airbag manufacturers care more about their benefits than the neutral and so-called “immoral” economists. Airbag manufacturers will surely try to hide their real purpose from the public, so they let their agents, including some other economists who appear to have no interest with them, to speak in public. Finally government implements the stipulation about airbags, ostensibly accepting the advice of some economists who are agents of airbag manufacturers while turning his back to the objective and neutral analysis. Some ignorant enjoy the pleasure of scolding the so-called “immoral” economists. Moreover, the drivers have to spend more money on car airbags, not knowing that they may bear a higher risk of car accident casualties!\nSuch cases happen again and again in reality: government asks for advice from economists about policy, but he may not be for the public’s interest. Some economists are either disabled or not objectively neutral. The public can not positively analyze the effect of the policy, so they do not know the truth and enjoy the pleasure of scolding others. The victims are harmed in ignorance, and at the same time, pay for the costs in silence.\nThe society is full of such self-interested persons who have complicated interests and speak with deceptions. One of the purposes of studying economics is precisely to learn to analyze objectively. Positive economics teaches us not to ask the questions of “ought to be”, but only or at least firstly ask the questions of “to be”. Please do not believe what the self-interested persons say, but observe what they do. It is not essential what the good intentions of the government’s policies are, while what the measurable effects they have mattered because the final effects often run counter with the original intentions.\nTherefore, normative economics, or “normative analysis”, must be based on the empirical or positive analysis. Only after the empirical analysis is conducted can we take value judgment into account. Take the example of airbags: what does government want? If he does want to reduce car accidents, it is not necessary to make a policy about airbags. It would be the opposite case for policy-making if what he wants is to benefit airbag manufacturers. A value judgment is not science but ethics, and government often has its idea, so economists should not put a finger in, or else they will just be used for the unspoken purpose.\n"},"Lecture05/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section03.html","title":"Section3: Value Judgment","keywords":"","body":"Section3: Value Judgment\nAs mentioned at the end of the previous lecture, non-price criteria would lead to rent dissipation which is a kind of transaction costs. Although there is not rent dissipation for price criterion, there is transaction cost (in a narrow sense) for using the market. What is more, in order for price criterion to be established, there must be a legal system protecting PPRs as the game rule, and there is also transaction cost (in a broad sense) for the establishment, operation and maintenance of the legal system. Therefore, whether people choose price criterion or non-price criteria depends on their transaction costs under different constraints. Self-interested people will, of course, choose the criterion with less transaction cost.\nIn fact, in such cases as to how to allocate seats in a classroom, people will seldom choose price criterion (e.g. auction). However, it is neither decided by democratic voting or by force, but the non-price criterion of first-come-first-served. Why? Because the benefit of the best seat is minor. In order to distribute such a minor benefit, it is not worth taking the trouble to organize an auction or voting, or fight with each other, which means there is transaction cost and it outweighs the benefit. Although there is rent dissipation (a kind of transaction costs) for first-come-first-served as a non-price criterion, it is still the least costly way among all for the allocation of seats in a classroom and chosen by self-interested people.\nIn reality, there are both market (price criterion) and non-market (non-price criteria) behaviors, but the latter is often ignored in MSE. There is a big issue related to this ignorance: is the market economy better or planned economy better? There was once a heated ideological debate in China, and today it seems that a conclusion has been reached that the market economy is good. Really?\nWhat is the meaning of “good”? If one likes an apple, he will think apples are good. While if one likes pears, he will think pears are good. Here good and bad are subjective value judgments, and there is no objective standard, so it is a question that science cannot answer. However, if an objective criterion (for example, the more the nutrition, the better) is set in advance, and it is also necessary to precisely determine what kind of nutrition it is, who will eat the fruit, and whether he lacks that kind of nutrition, which are all constraints, then science can answer the question “Which is better for someone, apple or pear?” Strictly speaking, science answers the question “which is more nutritious for someone, apple or pear”, and further answers the question “should someone eat apple or pear?”\nTurn to economics. Is the market economy better or planned economy better? If there is no objective standard set in advance, it can only be judged by subjective value, and economics as a science cannot answer. However, if “the less the cost is, the better” is the objective standard, the question becomes: “is the cost of a market economy or a planned economy less?” Market economy and planned economy are different economic institutions. As will be analyzed in the later lecture on “transaction costs”, the cost of an institution is the transaction costs in a broad sense. Therefore, this question is actually about the transaction costs of the market economy and planned economy. However, it can be seen from the above example of allocating the seats in a classroom that it is not enough when there is only objective standard because specific constraints are also needed. Without constraints, it is impossible to identify the transaction costs of different competition criteria.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, normative economics must be based on empirical analysis, along with objective standard which should be set in advance. Firstly in empirical analysis, different choices are analyzed under specific constraints. Then according to the objective standard set in advance, economics as science can answer the questions of “ought to be.”\n"},"Lecture05/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Problems of Welfare Economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Problems of Welfare Economics\nIn economics, the normative analysis is concentrated in a branch called “welfare economics”. Do not misunderstand that it is the study of the welfare economy; instead, it tries to use “waste” or “inefficiency” as an objective criterion to answer the question of “to be”.\nWelfare economics will be discussed in the later lecture of “The Coase Theorem”, and herein we just give a brief. There cannot be “waste” or “inefficiency” in economics, which is a direct conflict with the postulate of self-interest. In Lecture 3, it has been emphasized that there cannot be any theory or explanation conflict with the postulate of self-interest. In that lecture, it has also been pointed out that the so-called “irrationality” is wrong in that information costs (a kind of transaction costs) are ignored, so human is rational to choose to be ignorant. The so-called “waste” or “inefficiency” in welfare economics is also wrong in neglecting transaction costs.\nIn Lecture 1, it has been cautious that there are many mistakes in MSE. They stem from two primary sources, one of which is the omission of critical constraints, and transaction costs are precisely the constraints that are often overlooked. The theories neglecting transaction costs will be a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, and of course they are serious mistakes, just as the laws that are conflict with the Constitution are serious mistakes. If a law is unconstitutional, it must be amended to conform to the Constitution, or even repealed. According to the same logic, welfare economics, which takes “waste” or “inefficiency” as the criterion of value judgment and is a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, should be abandoned.\n"},"Lecture06/":{"url":"Lecture06/","title":"Lecture 6: The History of Economic Thinking -- Microeconomics and Macroeconomics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 6: The History of Economic Thinking -- Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\nEconomics is divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics, which copies the division of physics.

Newtonian mechanics belong to macro-physics which is measured in meter. And micro-physics study molecular and atomic levels of matter where the laws of movements are different from those followed by macroscopic objects.\nUnlike physics, there is microeconomics first, then macro later.

From then on to today, economics has gone through two stages: classical economics and neoclassical economics. Until today, it is still in the neoclassical period. In addition to Smith, the famous classical economists include David Ricardo (1772-1823), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), etc. Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) published “The Principles of Economics” in 1890, which marked the transition from classical economics to neoclassical economics, so he is the second greatest master only next to Smith in economics. His “Principles of Economics” is regarded as the first textbook in economics, and today’s economics textbooks all follow it in the structure. The masterpieces of classical economics such as Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”, Ricardo’s “On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation” and Mill’s “Principles of Political Economics” are obviously different from the current economics textbooks which are quite similar to Marshall’s “Principles of Economics”.\nThere were no terms of micro and macro in classical economics, but there were the concepts of them which were very different from those in neoclassical economics. In classical economics, there are two fields of study: resource allocation and income distribution. The former could be regarded as micro and the latter to be macro.\nClassical economics focuses on analyzing how the market mechanism (price criterion) guides the allocation of resources for production, and how the income from the sales of products is distributed to the owners of the resources. Classical economists advocated the free market and believed that government only needed to play the role of “a night watchman”. There are two duties for a night watchman: one is to tell the time, the other is to patrol for fire prevention and security. In other words, in the view of classical economists, the role of government was minimal, and it should not interfere in the market. The spontaneous working of the market was enough to arrange all kinds of economic activities in a society correctly.\nEven transmitting to neoclassical economics, economists were still of this opinion about the free market, and only introduced mathematics (mainly geometry) to present and deduce economic theories. Economists had long believed in the market.\n"},"Lecture06/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Rise and Decline of Keynesian Economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Rise and Decline of Keynesian Economics\nHowever, the Great Depression (GD) triggered by the stock crash in the United States from 1929 to 1933 which swept through the significant economies shook the public’s trust in economists, thus shaking economists’ trust in the market and even the economics itself.\nAccording to the theory of supply and demand that will be introduced later, the market can adjust demand and supply through price changes so that they are always equal. However, it seemed that the orthodox theories in economics could not explain the phenomena of overproduction (i.e. the supply of products exceeds the demand), continuous price decline (deflation, i.e. the demand of money exceeds the supply) and high unemployment rate (i.e. the supply of labor exceeds the demand) during the GD. \nEspecially the “Say’s Law” which believed that “supply would automatically create demand equal to itself” was regarded as an infallible law at that time. From the perspective of it, supply and demand could not be out of balance, let alone for a long time.\nDuring the GD, there was a bitter joke: A son asked his father, “Why don’t we buy coal for warming during this cold winter?” The father replied, “Because I lost my job, we have no money to buy coal.” The son asked again, “Why did you lose your job?” The father replied, “Because the coal company I worked for could not sell out the coals and went bankrupt, we as the employees were all fired.”\nHere is what the history textbooks record: President Roosevelt of the US stood up at this critical moment to implement the “New Deal” and turned the tide by government interventions in the market, saving the US economy, ending the GD, also ending the history of letting the free market spontaneously adjust the national economy, and starting the era of big government.\nSome views of Keynesian economics have been taught in the ideological and political education of middle school in China. It is the story in textbooks: British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) wrote his “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” in which he criticized the orthodox economics that advocated the free market, and then established a set of theories analyzing the national economy and advocating government interventions in the market.\nUnfortunately, these so-called “historical facts” which are vividly described in textbooks are wrong because of severe misunderstanding and misinterpretation. Friedman, the founder of the monetary school, co-authored with Anna Jacobsen Schwartz (1915-2012) “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960”. With a large number of facts, excellent statistical skills and dominant monetary theory, Friedman discovered the truth of this period of history by strict logical economic analysis, completely overturning previous understanding of the causes of the GD.\nRoosevelt’s New Deal was implemented earlier than Keynes’s “The General Theory”. On the contrary, Keynes was inspired to write his book by Roosevelt’s New Deal.\nHowever, it was not Roosevelt’s New Deal that freed the US from the GD, but war! The unemployment rate is a definite proof. At the beginning of the GD, the unemployment rate in the US was as high as 25%, which means one in four was unemployed. Later, the rate was reduced to about 10% due to the automatic adjustment of the market and the public works of the New Deal, but it was still severe unemployment. It was not until after the US went to the World War II that the problem of high unemployment had been really solved because many people joined the army to fight overseas, which significantly reduced the supply of labor, and the increasing demand for the war materials boosted the demand for labor. Only then did the US truly get rid of the GD. It was in 1929 that the stock market crashed, and it was in 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor that the US went to war, while it was since 1933 that Roosevelt’s New Deal had been implemented when he became president, so there are nearly ten years between them. If the New Deal was effective, the problem of high unemployment rate should have been solved.\nBesides Roosevelt tried to get rid of the GD with New Deal, Hitler also led the Germans to another road of self-rescue by starting a war, extricated Germany from the crisis much faster than the US, and even dominated the European continent, of course just temporarily.\nThere is an idiom in China called “quenching thirst with poison”. If it is judged whether it is useful only from whether it can quench thirst (get rid of the GD), poison (Hitler’s militarism) also works, but the final result is death. However, Keynes’s prescription is also a chronic poison, and just because its toxicity cannot be observed immediately, it seemed at the beginning to be effective, just as when Hitler came to power, he seemed to save Germany out of crisis overnight. So Keynesian economics was thought to be the remedy of economic diseases caused by market failure, and was widely used in almost all economies after World War II.\nKeynes was so ambitious that he originally intended to replace the traditional economics since Adam Smith completely. However, some economists made a compromise that traditional economics was also right, except that the scope of application was different from Keynesian economics. The former focuses on how the micro-entities in the market such as individuals and enterprises consume, produce and exchange guided by price. And the latter is concerned about how government closely monitors the national economy, just like a doctor caring for patients, and prescribes according to Keynesian economics to regulate the economy, ensuring that it moves forward on a healthy track. So these economists separate traditional economics from Keynesian economics, arguing that they apply to different fields, just like physics.\nThus, the traditional economics is renamed as “microeconomics”, and Keynesian economics is called “macroeconomics”. By the way, it was Keynes’s father who first introduced the concepts of micro and macro into economics from physics. This compromise of the traditional economics and Keynesian economics is known as “Neoclassical Synthesis” which includes both market mechanisms advocated by neoclassical economics and government regulations or interventions in the market by Keynesian economics. However, Keynes himself did not agree with neoclassical synthesis. Even Keynes and Keynesian School are of different opinions. In Keynesian School, neoclassical factors are added into Keynesian economics. For example, the IS-LM Model is established by this school instead of Keynes.\nHowever, in the 1970s, the sequela of governments taking Keynes’s prescription for long terms finally broke out. If the end of World War II in 1945 is taken as the starting point, it just took less than 30 years. Seen from the angle of long history, it was not a very chronic poisoning. It should be the oil crisis in the 1970s that accelerated the outbreak of the sequela, and a new term “stagflation” spread quickly, which was a phenomenon that Keynesian economics could not explain. In Keynesian economics, inflation and economic stagnation should replace each other, and could occur at the same time.\nThere have been questions on Keynes in economics, which was just not noticed by the public before. The Monetary School led by Friedman came first, followed by the Supply School and the Rational Expectation School. The neoclassical synthesis was also criticized to divide economics into micro and macro with entirely different application scope and irrelevant to each other. Some economists advocate “supplementation of the micro foundation for macro” which means that macroeconomics should be rebuilt based on microeconomics or neoclassical economics. However, it is more thorough that economics should not be divided into micro and macro at all!\n"},"Lecture06/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: Price Theory and Monetary Theory","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: Price Theory and Monetary Theory\nIn some universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the US, the appellations of micro and macro are considered misleading, and the terms of “price theory” and “monetary theory” are respectively used to replace them.\nAs mentioned above, economists of neo-classical synthesis classify traditional economics as microeconomics which focuses on the consumption, production and exchange of the micro-entities (individuals and firms) in the market guided by price. So government intervention is absent in microeconomics, or even if there is a government, it only behaves either like a consumer buying various goods in the market or a producer providing public services to the market. However, in macroeconomics, the role of government is exceptional. It functions as the regulator of the economy (mainly referring to the market), which is entirely different from the role of individuals and firms.\nThose who use the terms “price theory” and “monetary theory” instead of micro and macro are concerned about another difference that they think is essential: money.\nMicroeconomics studies how the price mechanism (price criterion) plays a role in the market and guides different economic entities to make choices. Here the price refers to the relative price in barter where there is no money, or there is money, but the value of money is stable, and the price level is also stable (i.e. there is no inflation or deflation), so the nominal price (monetary price) of a good is the same as its real price (relative price). Thus, there is no monetary effect on the economy, which means “monetary neutrality” advocated by classical economics.\nBy contrast, macroeconomics focuses on money. There is not only money in the economy, but also the value of money may fluctuate, which means the price level is unstable (i.e. there is inflation or deflation). Then the monetary price of a good is different from the real price, so affecting (actually misleading) the economic entities’ choices. And the money in modern nations is all issued by government: most are national governments, few are foreign governments, and Euro is the most special, issued by the European Central Bank, a super-government institution. Therefore, the source of instability of money value directly stems from government which also plays an exceptional role. However it should not interfere in the market and regulate the economy, but should control the money supply to stabilize the value of money and the price level, providing a stable platform for the automatic adjustment of the market. \nObviously, it is monetarists who advocate to replace micro and macro with price theory and monetary theory.\n"},"Lecture06/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Causes of the Great Depression","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Causes of the Great Depression\nIn the previous section, we have introduced briefly the history of economics from the classical period to the neoclassical period and how it “split” into micro and macro. Next, the causes of the Great Depression will be explained to illustrate why Keynesian economics was not the proper remedy to macro-economy, but just a chronic poison.\nIt is well known that the Great Depression began with the crash of the United States stock market in 1929. However, it is not well known that there were stock crashes more severe than that of 1929 both before and after the GD, but they all did not cause such disastrous consequences.\nSome may argue that there were not many investors in the stock market before 1929, so the severe stock crashes occurred in the past did not have so massive impacts as that of 1929. However, after 1929, there are more and more investors in the stock market. Why have more serious stock crashes not brought about as severe consequences as the GD? They may argue that after 1929, governments had Keynes’s prescription to prevent the spread of the stock crashes to macro-economy by intervention with the market. However, during the colonial period in Hong Kong, British-Hong Kong (BHK) government had been implementing the policy of “positive non-intervention” until it was terminated by the last Governor Chris Patten. Hong Kong was the last piece of land on the earth where Smith’s classical thought of “government only needs to play the role of night watchman” was still followed in modern society. During this period, Hong Kong had experienced some stock crashes not less severe than that of the US in 1929. Moreover, the BHK government had never taken any Keynesian prescriptions, but Hong Kong survived unscathed again and again, and the impacts of the stock crashes had never spread to macro-economy of Hong Kong and turned into economic crises.\nWhy? The answer is also the truth of the GD. The truth is: the cause of the stock crash in the US in 1929 was utterly different from that of most stock crashes. The real cause of that stock crash was also the real cause of the economic crisis which the stock crash later turned into. In other words, the stock crash is just the prelude to the GD, not the cause of it. A stock crash alone will not necessarily cause an economic crisis. However, neither will an economic crisis necessarily turn into a great depression. It was a series of mishandling by the US government that turned an ordinary economic crisis that had happened many times before into an unprecedented economic catastrophe - the Great Depression!\nFriedman in his “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960” traced back in detail the data of money supply before and after the stock crash in 1929, eloquently showing that before 1929, the US central bank (the Federal Reserve, or the Fed) injected a large amount of money into the economy. The later lecture of “Monetary Theory” in this book will expound that if the growth of the money supply is out of line with that of the real economy, there will be inflation. However, people (even economists) at that time knew little about monetary theory. That is why the truth or real cause of the GD has been misunderstood for long.\nWhen producers found that the price (nominal price) of goods was rising, they would think that their products were so popular in the market that the demand exceeded the supply. With the stimulus of rising price, they significantly increased production and employed more workers. Because the demand for labor increased, with the limited labor supply, the wage also increased. Workers found that their wages increased, and producers found their profits increased. Everyone found his income increased, and all spent more, so in the short term, the increased supply seemed to be consumed by the increased demand. Investors also spent more money in the stock market, firstly because more income would naturally lead to more savings (the so-called “investment” in the stock market is the same as savings in economics), and secondly because the increase in profits of enterprises made investors full of confidence in the rise of stock prices. As long as there are enough investors who had such confidence, and more chose to buy in stocks instead of selling out, the stock prices would keep rising.\nHowever, everything had an end. It was too much money flowing into the economy that caused “Money Illusion” in the short term, which made people not know that the general rise in prices was inflation, not real economic growth. The illusion is after all only an illusion, not reality. What was praised by the historians as the “roaring 1920s” was just an illusion of prosperity stimulated by inflation in the eyes of the economists. Sooner or later, producers would find that everything was more expensive, not just their products, and their costs also increased, squeezing their profits, so they no longer expanded the productions, but shrank. Consumers also would find that everything was more expensive, not just their incomes, so they cut back on spending. All of a sudden, the wind changed, and the stock market is the most sensitive to the change of economic wind, so the stock price suddenly turned to plummet. Previously, due to the soaring stock prices, a large number of funds that could not bear high risks (such as bank deposits) were attracted into the stock market. The sudden collapse of stock prices wiped out these funds overnight. As a result, several banks went bankrupt, triggering a crisis of confidence in banks. Even the banks that had no problems in trouble were drawn into a run on the banks.\nThese problems in finance quickly spread to the real economy where there was overproduction caused by the illusion of inflation. It is necessary to realize that the overproduction was not the fault of the market at all! It was the central bank (the Fed) that issued too much money, which led to inflation and misled producers into thinking that the rise in product prices was due to the rise in demand, but it was wrong. What had risen was only money supply, so the nominal or monetary price of goods increased, but the real or relative price of goods had not changed at all. Nevertheless, how could producers know that? In a monetary society, what producers could directly observe is the monetary price of their products, and could not know if the central bank had issued too many money, so they would respond to the price rising by expanding productions. If the price as a signal for the demand and supply had been distorted by inflation, the producers’ response would be wrong, because the increased supply had no corresponding increase in demand to consume. That is precisely the real reason why there is a so-called overproduction.\nThe traditional economics (the so-called microeconomics) thinks that the market will pass information about supply and demand to various economic entities by the rise and fall of prices. Prices will rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when demand exceeds supply. All economic entities are self-interested or rational to respond accordingly: when prices rise, producers increase supply and consumers reduce demand; while when prices fall, producers reduce supply and consumers increase demand. These responses are all pushing the changes of supply and demand to be equal. Therefore, it is inconceivable that there will be overproduction for traditional economics. However, the problem lies in the fact that there is money in reality, and the central bank may implement wrong monetary policies due to ignorance or intentionally – before the GD, the Fed were ignorant, but most of the inflations were initiated intentionally. The wrong monetary policy will lead to instability of the money value which appears as the monetary price out of line with the real one. Thus, the information implied by the money prices is not only about supply and demand, but also mixed with the “noise” of inflation, which misleads producers (in fact, including consumers) to respond not to push the changes of supply and demand to be equal, but to be unequal.\nIs this the fault of market or government (central bank)? Who has distorted the price? Who has made the information implied by monetary price mixed with the noise of inflation? Who has misled producers and consumers?\nThere was an even more terrible story to come. The inequality of supply and demand caused the stock crash, which caused a bank crisis. The sharp contraction of the money supply caused by the bank crisis will, in turn, worsen the economic crisis, which will be explained in the later lecture of “Monetary Theory”. In a word, according to the monetary theory understood only by later economists, central bank should increase the money supply when the economy was in recession. However, the Fed did not realize that it had made a mistake of injecting too much money into the economy until after the stock crash, and suddenly changed the monetary policy to tighten the money supply, which is precisely the opposite of what they should do in a financial crisis. It was so dramatic, and it should be said to be tragic! In order to correct a mistake made before, a more significant mistake had been made at the wrong time.\nAs a result, the US economy worsened from an economic crisis characterized by overproduction which had happened before, to a great depression characterized by a continuous sharp fall in prices (severe deflation). The price could not even make up for the cost of transporting the products to the market, so producers chose to destroy them all on the spot to reduce the loss. That was the reason why there were the ridiculous phenomena recorded in history textbooks: milk was poured into the river, and chickens were drowned in the water, instead of being sold out.\n"},"Lecture06/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: More Truths about the Great Depression","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: More Truths about the Great Depression\nThe cause of the Great Depression explained by Friedman’s “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960” has been expounded in the previous section. However, this terrible story had more tragic developments, because Friedman only explained the phenomena of overproduction and severe deflation, but did not explain why there had been such a high unemployment rate for ten years. The authorities of the US, not just the Fed, had made a series of serious mistakes, which coincidently joint together to cause such an unprecedented GD.\nThe first big blunder was that the US Congress had just approved business income tax which was vehemently opposed by the traditional economists because it was suspected as double taxation. The profits distributed to the corporate owners after the business income tax would be taxed again by the personal income tax. Here we would not discuss if the business income tax was true or false, but point out that it was equivalent to tax increase. Even Keynesian economics would suggest that in an economic recession government should stimulate the growth of the economy with a tax cut. However, the US Congress at that time increased instead of a decreased tax, which of course further aggravated the shutdown of enterprises, thus increasing unemployment.\nThe second big blunder was that the US Congress was so foolish to approve the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 to substantially raise import duties despite strong oppositions from other countries. Different from the US today, it had trade surplus at that time, how stupid it is to embrace protectionism with such “favorable” trade balance! It was easy to guess what would other countries respond. Yes, they retaliated by also raising the tariffs on the exports of US. As a result, the tariff war broke out, and the international trade plummeted to only one-third of the original value within one year. The hard-hit exports naturally could not help the US economy to get rid of the GD as the Tariff Act had expected, but just made it worsen on the contrary.\nThe third big blunder was the biggest one, whose influence was much worse than the mistakes made by the Fed and the US Congress. It was the minimum wage, trade unions and other institutions that hinder the wage reductions, which led to high unemployment for ten years. Even with chaotic monetary policies which caused severe deflation, and domestic and foreign tax increase, there would not be large-scale and long-term unemployment so long as prices (wages) in the labor market could be flexibly adjusted downward.\nFirstly, the minimum wage, trade unions and other similar institutions nullify the essential role of the (labor) market in equalizing the supply and the demand by adjusting the prices (wages).  In the economic recession, the productions shrink, so the demand for labor decreases. The market is supposed to equalize the supply and the demand by adjusting the price downward. However, if the equilibrium wage which can equalize the supply and the demand in labor market to eliminate unemployment is lower than that stipulated by minimum wage, the market’s adjustment function will, of course, fail to work. If the supply of products exceeds the demand, they cannot be sold; if the supply of labor exceeds the demand, they cannot be sold either, which is precisely unemployment. Is it the market’s fault, or the government’s? Who forbids the market’s adjustment function to work? Who causes the labor market to be disequilibrium with oversupply? Who forces those who may be willing to sell their labor at a price lower than the minimum wage to become unemployed without any income?\nSecondly, the profits of enterprises do be reduced by the price fall in the product market (deflation) and tax increase, which have pushed many enterprises to the edge of a shutdown. However, if the labor cost can be reduced along with the profits reduce, the burden of the enterprises can always be lightened to some extent, thus saving some of them to survive. The survival of enterprises is the most reliable guarantee for the employment of labor.\nReviewing the truth of the GD, one can only sigh and conclude that how wronged traditional economics (and economists) are! However, the most seriously wronged is the market! The market has done nothing wrong. It is human who distorts the price signals with wrong monetary policies. It is also human who with minimum wage law, trade unions and other similar institutions nullify the market’s adjustment function of equalizing the supply and the demand. However, again it is human (such as Keynes) who blame the failure on the market, claiming that if the market is allowed to operate freely, it will cause insufficient aggregate demand, overproduction, high unemployment etc. So the government needs to be like a hero in an economic crisis, standing up to correct market’s errors. It is similar to that someone buys a machine and does not follow the instructions of the manual to mishandle it, causing such a severe problem that others are hurt or even killed, but he blames the machine for having design defects!\nWell, the market is not a person, so it can not stand up to defend itself against human’s slander and false accusation. It does not matter, because it is the economic rule that is the final judger. One can wrong the market, but he cannot escape the punishment of economic rule, just as one is sure to fall from the sky and lose his life if he does not follow Newton’s laws. As the history of Keynesian economics mentioned in section 2, only 30 years later, the punishment of economic rule had come.\nUntil nowadays, there have been such punishments in various countries around the world. The specific plots of tragedies may be different, but there is no fundamental difference in essence. The latest ones are the financial turmoil in the US in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe in 2009.\nHuman should keep his eyes open to see the truth clearly: it is human, not the market, who has been torturing himself!\n"},"Lecture07/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Equilibrium and Optimum","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 7: Equilibrium•Optimum•Margin\nSection 1: Equilibrium and Optimum\nAs mentioned in the previous lecture, economics has copied many concepts from physics. One case is the division of micro and macro, while here is another case of the concept of “Equilibrium” which is very important in economics.\nEquilibrium in physics means that an object is in the state of static or uniform linear motion due to the force balance. For example, the mobile phone on the table is static. Why? Because it is now subject to two forces, one is gravity, and the other is the force of the table supporting it. The two forces are of the same magnitude, but of the opposite directions, so reach a balance, and the mobile phone is in a static state.\nEconomics has copied the concept of equilibrium from physics which refers to a state of static (there cannot be the so-called state of uniform linear motion) when the economic forces are of the same magnitude and the opposite directions. For example, the theory of supply and demand analyzes the two most conventional economic forces in the market: the buyer’s demand for commodities and the seller’s supply of them. These two forces work in opposite directions: buyer’s demand pushes the price to rise, while the seller’s supply pushes it to fall. When they are of the same magnitude, the price will stabilize and remain stationary.\nHowever, economists later find that there are cases when there cannot be at least two economic forces to reach a balance. After all, this concept is copied from physics, and, inevitably, there will often be cases that are incompatible with it. Therefore, economists have revised equilibrium to refer to the state that under certain constraints, each economic entity will no longer adjust his behavior (i.e. remain stationary). Why do economic entities no longer adjust their behaviors? It must be because, under such constraints, they have reached the most favorable positions for themselves, so they are satisfied with staying there, not changing any more. If they have not reached the most favorable positions, the postulate of self-interest implies that they will continue to adjust their behaviors. Equilibrium used in consumer theory, the theory of firm and game theory is such meaning instead of the “force balance” directly copied from physics.\nIn economics, the concept of “optimum” is also often used to describe the above state that individuals adjust their behaviors according to the constraints to make themselves in the most favorable positions. Optimum and equilibrium are related to each other because equilibrium is the overall result when all economic entities have chosen the optimal behaviors. In other words, it is optimum from the perspective of an individual, while it is equilibrium from the perspective of all as a whole. \nHowever, equilibrium in economics is problematic, since this concept in physics is a fact, while it is not in economics. Look out of the window. Cars are running roughly the road or parking on the side, and which one is in the state of equilibrium in physics? The answer is obvious: the parked cars and the running ones in uniform linear motion which can be measured with appropriate tools.  However, look out of the window, is the world in the state of equilibrium in economics? No matter the answer is yes or no, what is the reason? Equilibrium in physics is a fact which is observable or at least measurable with tools, while equilibrium in economics is not a fact because it is neither observable nor measurable.\nAnother criticism that can give a fatal blow to this concept is that since equilibrium refers to the state when individuals all reach the optimum under certain constraints, how can there be disequilibrium? Disequilibrium should mean that individuals do not reach the optimum under certain constraints, which is a conflict with the postulate of self-interest. How can a self-interested person not reach the optimum?\nSome may argue if the constraints change suddenly, the individuals who were in the original state of equilibrium will not have time to adjust their behaviors, so they are in the state of disequilibrium before they adjust their behaviors to reach the new equilibrium. However, it only means that there is transaction cost to adjust the behavior (including the information cost needed to realize that the constraints of the original equilibrium have changed), which is also one kind of constraints. It is wrong to think that individuals are in disequilibrium before they adjust their behaviors to reach the new equilibrium in that the constraint of transaction cost is neglected. In lecture 5, it has been warned that there are many mistakes in mainstream economics, one of which is precisely the neglect of the transaction cost as a constraint. Once the constraint of transaction cost is neglected, there will be mistakes conflict with the postulate of self-interest. The problematic concept of “disequilibrium” once again proves this warning.\nIn short, if all the constraints are taken into account, there is impossible to be disequilibrium in economics. Then what is the sense of equilibrium? Some economists, such as Coase and Steven. N. S. Cheung, have suggested altogether abolishing this concept. However, equilibrium has been used too long and too widely in economics, and intertwined with other economic theories and deeply rooted, so the cost of completely abolishing it is too high. I suggest retaining this concept, but all disequilibrium analysis must be swept out of economics because they are conflict with the postulate of self-interest. Thus the answer to the question whether the world is in the state of equilibrium is: always yes! Anyone who answers no is equivalent to claiming that he does not accept the postulate of self-interest.\nWith transaction cost, some seeming disequilibrium cases are equilibrium ones, which is quite similar to the cases with friction in physics. Imagine a heavy object is pushed by force, but stay still or in equilibrium. Why is that so? It is because the object is also subjected to a friction force in the opposite direction to the push, and of the same magnitude to it, so they offset each other, and the object remains stationary. However, as long as the push to the object is large enough, it will eventually be a move against the friction.\nSimilarly, according to the TSD in economics, if the supply or the demand has changed, the original equilibrium price should fluctuate. However, in reality, price will not change every minute with the always-changing supply and demand. Is the price in the state of disequilibrium? Have facts refuted the TSD? There are cases where the price changes every minute with the always-changing supply and demand in the stock market. It is the transaction cost of adjusting the price every minute that prevents a self-interested human from doing so unless the increase in income from adjusting the price is higher than the transaction cost. The stock prices fluctuate every minute because the stock market is precisely the place with the lowest transaction cost for price adjustment, where a complicated computer system is used to match the supply and demand automatically. \nIf the TSD can only be used to explain the stock price changes, how narrow its application is! In order to avoid falsification of the TSD, it needs to be supplemented with the constraint of transaction cost in price adjustment. With this constraint, a theory with much stronger explanatory power can be deduced, giving new impetus to the traditional TDS: the higher the transaction cost of adjusting price, the lower the frequency of price fluctuations, vice versa.\nFor example, vegetables are sold both in farmers markets and supermarkets. The prices of the vegetables in farmers markets are more flexible than in supermarkets because the transaction cost for price adjustment of the former is lower than that of the latter. The farmers are the owners of the vegetables they sold and have the complete right to set the prices. By contrast, salesmen in the supermarkets are not vegetable owners and have to report to their managers to obtain permissions if the prices need to be adjusted. It is evident that the internal decision-making process of a supermarket is much more time-consuming, so it is possible that when the day is over and the vegetables have been rotted away, the decision about price adjustment has not been made. The much more time-consuming decision-making process implies the much higher transaction cost in supermarkets than in farmers markets, which is the reason why the prices of the vegetables in the latter fluctuate more frequently than in the former.\nThus, the world is always in a state of equilibrium. The so-called disequilibrium phenomenon which seems to refute the TSD is merely due to the neglect of the transaction cost in adjusting prices. It is not a tautology; otherwise, it is also tautology that friction is used to explain why a heavy object may not be pushed to move in physics. More importantly, the above example of vegetable sales demonstrates how to identify different transaction cost by observing different phenomena. Based on these observable facts, instead of an unobservable concept like equilibrium, we can explain why the vegetables in farmers markets and supermarkets have different frequencies of price fluctuation, which rejected the statement that the vegetables in supermarkets with lower frequencies of price fluctuation are in a state of disequilibrium.\nTherefore, economics only needs Static Analysis (the analysis of a particular equilibrium) and Comparative Static Analysis (the analysis of comparing two different equilibriums) which is the analysis of the difference in the constraints of the equilibriums. What is more, economics needs neither disequilibrium analysis nor Dynamic Analysis (the analysis of the process of changing from one equilibrium to another, and it is disequilibrium in the process), because they are wrong in neglecting transaction cost.\nBesides, there is another reason why I suggest retaining the concept of “equilibrium”. There cannot be disequilibrium analysis, but disequilibrium can be used as a tool to help to check if a theory or explanation is right. \nFor example, the conclusions of any economic theories must not be a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, which means they must be in the state of equilibrium. So if the conclusions deduced from a specific theory imply disequilibrium, it must be wrong, the logic of which is equivalent to the reductio in mathematics. It is quite useful to judge whether a theory is wrong, so it is a use of disequilibrium in testing theories.\nFurthermore, if there is disequilibrium in the explanation of a phenomenon, some constraints (often transaction cost) must have been neglected. As far as theories are concerned, economics is not as difficult as natural science like physics, chemistry and biology. However, the difficulty of economics lies in the applications, and mainly lies in investigating the constraints. There may be thousands of constraints relevant to a phenomenon, so it is not easy to screen out the key constraints, which means that information cost is an important constraint in the study of economics. Here disequilibrium helps to find out whether some key constraints are missing. However, it cannot directly tell what the specific constraints are, which still depends on investigations and perhaps experiences. After all, it is still a handy tool to detect omission in an explanation. \nIn brief, disequilibrium can be used as a tool to check if the conclusions of a theory are conflict with the postulate of self-interest and if there are omissions of constraints in an explanation.\n"},"Lecture07/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Concept of Margin","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Concept of Margin\nWhat will be introduced next is the analysis tool for finding an optimum which is the essential analysis tool in economics: marginal analysis.\nIn Lecture 3, the postulate of self-interest has been explained in detail, which refers to that human will try to achieve the best result with the least cost. It is the same meaning of optimum.\nAs mentioned in Lecture 6 about the history of economic thinking, an essential development in the process from classical economics to neoclassical economics is the introduction of mathematics as a deductive tool. Then how to interpret the postulate of self-interest in terms of mathematics?  The answer is the method of finding extrema: the least cost is finding minimum value, while the best result is finding maximum value. Furthermore, how to find extrema in mathematics? In geometry, it is to find where the slope of a curve is zero, or the tangent of a curve at that point is horizontal. While in algebra, it is to find when the derivative is zero.\nA new and important concept of margin is born by the introduction of this mathematical thought (not only the calculation) into economics. From the 1870s to the beginning of the 20th century, the British economist William Stanley Jevons, the French economist Léon Walras of Lausanne School and Carl Menger of the Austrian School independently put forward “margin”, which is called \"marginal revolution\" in the history of economic thinking. From then on, there is marginal analysis everywhere in economics.\nWhat is “margin”? Since this concept initially came from mathematics, the following expounding will start from the perspective of mathematics, and then extend to the economic implication which is not entirely the same as mathematics.\nReaders should be very familiar with two kinds of magnitudes: total magnitude and average magnitude. For example, the total weight of all people in a room is a total magnitude, while the average weight or the weight per capita is calculated by dividing the total weight by the number of people. However, the most crucial magnitude in economics is not total and average magnitudes but marginal magnitude. If someone walks in, which increases the number of people, the total weight will rise. The weight of that person is a marginal magnitude. Moreover, if someone walks out, which decrease the number of people, the total weight will fall. The weight of that person is again a marginal magnitude. \nLet us take an economic example. The two geometric diagrams in Fig.7-1 respectively show the relationship between total revenue (R), average revenue (AR) and marginal revenue (MR). The upper diagram pictures the R function, and the lower diagram the associated AR and MR function. Warning: A total magnitude (such as R in the upper panel) should never be plotted on the same diagram as average and marginal magnitudes (such as AR and MR in the lower panel) because the units of measurement are not the same. The vertical axis of the upper diagram of Fig.7-1 is scaled in dollars, whereas the lower diagram is scaled in dollars per unit quantity.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1\n\nIn algebra, the average magnitude is derived from total magnitude such as $AR = \\frac{R}{Q}$, while the corresponding marginal magnitude is $\\frac{ΔR}{ΔQ}$. According to calculus, if the units of R are continuous, and the change of Q (ΔQ) is infinitely small, it can be rewritten as $\\frac{dR}{dQ}$which is a derivative.\nIn geometry, the average curve is also derived from the total curve. The magnitude of any point on an average curve is the slope of a ray from the origin to the corresponding point on the total curve. Take point N in Fig7-1 as an example. The slope of ON is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, which is dividing Y-coordinate of point N by X-coordinate of it. Y-coordinate represents total revenue (R), while X-coordinate represents quantity (Q). So the diagram implies the same as $AR = \\frac{R}{Q}$ in algebra. How about marginal magnitude? According to calculus, the derivative is the same as the slope of a curve in geometry. Therefore, the magnitude of any point on the marginal curve is the slope of the total curve.\nAfter the introduction about the derivation of average and marginal magnitudes from total magnitudes in terms of algebra and geometry, let us turn to the relations among these three magnitudes. There are a series of propositions.\nLet us continue to take the previous example of people’s weight in a room. When a person walks in, his weight as a marginal magnitude is positive, and the total weight of the people in the room will rise. So the first proposition about the relationship between total magnitude and marginal magnitude is: When a total magnitude is rising, the corresponding marginal magnitude is positive. On the contrary, if a person walks out, his weight as a marginal magnitude is negative, and the total weight of the people in the room will fall. So the second proposition about the relationship between total magnitude and marginal magnitude is: When a total magnitude is falling, the corresponding marginal magnitude is negative.\nThen look at the upper diagram Fig7-1, where is the maximum value of the total revenue (curve R)? It is on the “top of the mountain”. What is the slope there? The answer is zero. That is why in the lower diagram in Fig7-1, the corresponding point in the MR curve is on the X-axis, which means the X-coordinate is zero there. This total curve is a parabola going downwards, but if it is a parabola going upwards, the minimum value of it is at the “bottom of the valley”, where the slope is also zero. So extreme value, no matter it is a maximum or a minimum, appears where the slope is zero on the total curve. In other words, when a total magnitude reaches a maximum or a minimum, the corresponding marginal magnitude is zero, which is the third proposition.\nThe previous three propositions are all about the relations between total and marginal magnitudes, and how about average and marginal magnitudes? Suppose a person walks in, but he now needs to be classified as “fat” or “thin”. If he is heavier than the average weight of the people in the room before he walks in, he is fat. On the contrary, if he is lighter than the average weight, he is thin. It is very reasonable. If a “fat” walks in (geometrically the marginal curve lies above the average curve), the average weight will rise. If a “thin” walks in (geometrically the marginal curve lies below the average curve), the average weight will fall. If a person who is neither fat nor thin (i.e. he is as heavy as the average weight) walks in, the average weight will not change.\nTo sum up, when the average magnitude is falling, the marginal magnitude must lie below it, which is the fourth proposition. On the contrary, when the average magnitude is rising, the marginal magnitude must lie above it, which is the fifth proposition. Finally, when an average magnitude is neither rising nor falling (at a minimum or maximum), the marginal magnitude equals the average magnitude, which is the sixth proposition.\nGeometrically, the marginal curve passes through the highest or lowest point of the average curve. Fig.7-2 shows the relations among these three magnitudes taking total cost, average cost and marginal cost as the example. Let us focus on the lower diagram of average and marginal cost curves which are both parabolas going upwards. To the left of point L, the MC (marginal cost) curve lies below the AC (average cost) curve, which means MC＜AC, so AC is pulled down by MC. To the right of point L, the MC curve lies above the AC curve, which means MC＞AC, so AC is pulled upward by MC. The AC curve is falling to the left of L and rising to the right of L, so L is a turning point where is the “bottom” or the lowest point of the AC curve, and through which the MC curve passes.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2\n\nReaders can deduce by themselves the reverse case where both the average and marginal curves are parabolas going downwards. In the beginning, the marginal curve lies above the average curve, pulling it upward. Later, the marginal curve lies below the average curve, pulling it downward. The turning point, where the average curve changes from rising to falling, is the “top” or the highest point of the average curve, and through which the marginal curve passes.\n\nMathJax = {\n  tex: {\n    inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]\n  },\n  svg: {\n    fontCache: 'global'\n  }\n};\n\n\n"},"Lecture07/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Economic Implication of Marginal Analysis","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Economic Implication of Marginal Analysis\nIn the previous section, the concept of margin has been introduced from the perspective of mathematics. However, margin is an economic instead of mathematical concept, or else it should not be called “margin” but “derivative”. Margin is still significantly different from derivative in that there is requirement of “continuously differentiability” for derivative. As the example of the weight of people in a room in the previous section, that a person walks in is an incremental change of a discrete instead of a continuous variable because a person cannot be split into two halves, let alone into infinite numbers of infinitesimal persons. Strictly speaking, a discrete variable can not be taken the derivative. However, that is the requirement of mathematics, not economics which is not so demanding. As long as there is incremental change, no matter it is discrete or continuous, it is a margin.\nAs mentioned in Lecture 3, the postulate of self-interest cannot be directly applied to explain human’s behaviors, but should be along with different constraints. If the constraints do not change, neither will human change his behavior, nor will the postulate of self-interest be meaningful. Economics is applied to predict that human will change his behavior according to both the postulate of self-interest and the change of constraints. By investigating whether human really change his behavior as predicted, economics including the postulate of self-interest is tested.\nSelf-interest is a postulate about the motivation of human’s behaviors, and is unobservable intention. However, the change of constraints and human’s behaviors are both observable facts. The postulate of self-interest and the change of constrains constitute the economic explanations which are tested by the change of human’s behaviors. Therefore, if there is no change, there will be neither explanations nor tests. And change is margin! Difference is the same as change, which is also margin: that the same person changes his behaviors along with the change of constraints is logically similar to that different persons have different behaviors under different constraints. \nReview the concept of margin from the perspective of mathematics introduced in previous section: MR or MC is the change of total revenue or cost due to the rise of Q. Similarly, from the perspective of economics, the change of human’s behaviors is due to the change of constraints. This is the economic implication of marginal analysis, which can include all kinds of human’s behaviors and constraints, and that is why marginal analysis is so important in economics.\nNext, we will introduce various applications of marginal analysis in detail.\nFirstly, the basic application of marginal analysis is to explain phenomena or behaviors by using the postulate of self-interest without falling into the trap of tautology.\nFor example, there is a question as homework I designed: a girl claims that she often offers her seat to others on the bus, so she is not self-interested or rational. One of the replies is, “The benefit of psychological comfort from offering her seat on the bus outweighs the loss from the tiredness of standing, so she chooses to offer her seat. By contrast, those who do not offer their seats think the benefit of psychological comfort is too little for them to outweigh the loss of standing.” Is the reply right? How should you refute the girl?\nThe answer to this question is: the reply seems reasonable, but in fact it directly uses the postulate of self-interest to explain the girl’s behavior, which is a tautology. In order to avoid making the mistake of tautology, the change of constraint must be added, which means marginal analysis must be applied. But how? The girl says that she offers her seat “often” instead of “always”. Why does she sometimes offer her seat but sometimes not? Is she sometimes self-interested or rational and sometimes not? It is obviously ridiculous. This is the best refute to the girl.\nOf course, it is not the purpose of economics to refute the girl, but to explain her behavior scientifically. Sometimes she offers her seat and sometimes not, not because she is sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because the constraints she faces at different times are different, which leads to different behaviors. The girl will offer her seat on the short-distance bus, but how about on the long-distance train? Once she has offered her seat, she will have to stand for hours or even a whole day. Will she still choose to offer her seat? The girl will offer her seat to the old, children and pregnant women, but how about those who are strong and young? Will she still choose to offer her seat to them?\nThe above cases are not chosen randomly, but purposefully. The former case is about the change in the constraint of increasing cost, while the latter case is about the change in the constraint of decreasing income (the non-monetary income of psychological comfort). It is clear that with the change of constraints, the girl’s behaviors have also changed, and the direction of the change is in line with the postulate self-interest, which means when the cost of offering her seat increases or the income decreases, she tends not to do so. Thus, her own behaviors have definitely refuted her claim that she is not self-interested or rational.\nIn a word, it is the basic application of marginal analysis: to add the change of constraint to the postulate, concepts or theories with the nature of tautology, so that the explanations using them become refutable and scientific.\nSecondly, there are three extended application of marginal analysis.\n(1) Marginal analysis can be used to screen the key constraints.\nThere are thousands of constraints in reality, but it is impossible for all of them to have critical impacts on the phenomena or behaviors to be explained. One of the important applications of marginal analysis is to help to screen the false constraints that seem to have impacts.\nSpecifically, observe whether there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or whether there is the same behavior under different constraints. If the constraint remains unchanged, neither should the relevant behavior change. On the contrary, the behavior will change along with the change of constraint. Therefore, if there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or if there is the same behavior under different constraints, that the relevant constraints may be redundant and not the key ones.\nFor example, since 2012, China has implemented the policy of free passage of cars with less than seven seats on expressways during the National Day. As a result, there has been serious traffic jam on expressways during the National Day. Different parties have explained this phenomenon differently. Economics is a science, and should avoid the disturbance of subjective feelings and interests to judge these explanations from an objective perspective. It is precisely where marginal analysis is very useful.\nSome argue that the traffic jam on expressways is not due to the policy of free passage, but because there are always more cars using expressways during the National Day holiday than usual. In other words, in this explanation, the National Day holiday is regarded as the key constraint which causes traffic jam. However, there was the National Day holiday not only since 2012, which means this constraint has not changed at all. How can it cause the change in the phenomenon that traffic jam was significantly more serious than that in previous years? Thus, it has refuted this explanation of the National Day holiday as the key constraint.\nSome others argue that it may be because the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day in 2012 were linked together, resulting in more traffic than previous years. In this explanation, the long holidays are still regarded as the key constraint, but just the 8-day long holiday of 2012 is longer than before (7 days). However, with marginal analysis, this explanation is again easily refuted. If traffic jam was really caused by the longest holiday in history, this constraint is exactly the same for expressway and national highway. According to marginal analysis, if the constraint is the same, the phenomenon or behavior should be the same, which here means there should the same traffic jams on national highways as on expressways. However, there was not such news of serious traffic jams in national highways.\n(2) In economics, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation, so marginal analysis is more useful.\nDifferent from natural science, it is almost impossible to obtain the total magnitude of a social phenomenon in social science. Fortunately, with marginal analysis, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation.\nLet us continue to take the free policy on expressways during the National Day since 2010 as an example. According to marginal analysis, we can infer that the free policy is more likely to cause those who originally planned to go out to change from using national highways to expressways than to cause those who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. When one changes from not going out to going out, the increase in marginal cost will not only include the toll of expressways, but also the expense on oil, food, housing and so on. However, if one has already planned to go out, the increase in marginal cost is only the difference of toll between national highways and expressways, which is actually negative with the free policy. Therefore, the free policy will cause all who have planned to go out to change from using national highways to using expressways, but just cause some who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. We do not need to investigate how much precisely the total cost of going out is, but just need to logically identify the change in marginal cost.\n(3) Equal marginal principle is a useful application of marginal analysis.\nEqual marginal principle which will be discussed in the later lecture of “Market Structure: Price-Searching” is a very useful application of marginal analysis. It can be proved by mathematics that in order to achieve optimum, all relevant factors should be equal on the margin. For example, for producers, in order to achieve so-called profit maximization (strictly speaking, rent maximization), he should try to equalize the marginal revenue and marginal cost of the production (i.e. MR=MC), which is also called production equilibrium.\nIt is a more technical application of marginal analysis, and is widely used in mathematical models. However, even without mathematics, it can be also applied in economics. It can be inferred from equal marginal principle that it is optimal if this principle is satisfied, while it is not optimal if this principle is not satisfied.\nLet us continue to take the free policy on expressways as an example. This free policy seems to be beneficial to people. However, the cost of expressways will not disappear, so the question of how to collect enough money to cover the cost remains. If there is toll for passage of expressways, the cost is covered by those who use expressways. By contrast, if it is free to use expressways, governments need to input fiscal money to cover the cost through tax collection. In the former case, those who use expressways pay the cost, so it is clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal. By contrast, in the latter case, those who use expressways do not pay, but all tax-payers, no matter whether they have used expressways or not, pay the cost by paying taxes. It is not clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal, because the users and payers are not the same people.\nIt is normally thought that the former case is fair while the latter case is unfair. However, economics forbids value judgment. Seen from economics, in the former case, it is easier to achieve the optimum that marginal income is equal to marginal cost, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is lower. By contrast, in the latter case, it is difficult to achieve this optimum, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is higher. Because the users and payers are not the same, the relationship between cost and income is not clear, which causes the so-called “waste” and is harmful to the interest of the whole society by using more social wealth or income to pay higher transaction cost.\nIt is also why there is higher transaction cost for indirect payment than direct payment. It is difficult for a consumer to know whether his consumption has reached the optimum where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, because the cost paid by him is not directly related to the revenue from his consumption. In other words, the information cost (a kind of transaction cost) about the optimal consumption is higher. In particular, consumers misunderstand that there is no cost when there is free policy, but in fact they have paid the cost indirectly by paying taxes, so they will consume too much, which means they consume more than the optimum determined by equal marginal principle, and the part of actual consumption exceeding the optimum is a waste with the cost greater than revenue.\nCaution: even when there is no free policy implemented by government, the market will sometimes voluntarily chooses to use indirect payment, because under some constraint, it is possible that although the transaction cost of indirect payment is relatively higher, there is some other benefit which can cover the transaction cost, and indirect payment is optimal as a whole.\nAs for the example of free policy on expressways, those without cars are often poorer, while those with cars are often richer. It seems extremely unfair to pay the cost of expressways with taxes instead of collecting tolls, because it is equivalent to force the poor who have no cars and do not use expressways but have to pay taxes for expressways to subsidize the rich. However, the key point is those that infringe PPRs are evil policies or laws, no matter whether they infringe the PPRs of the rich or the poor. Therefore, the free policy on expressways is an evil policy not because it “robs” the poor to help the rich, but because it “robs” those who do not use expressways no matter they are poor or rich. No economic theory agrees with “rob the rich to give the poor”.\n"},"Lecture08/":{"url":"Lecture08/","title":"Lecture 8: The Law of Demand","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 8: The Law of Demand\nThe postulate of self-interest has been introduced in Lecture 3. Just like geometry, axiom is derived from postulate.

(See Fig8-1)\n\n  \n\nFigure 8-1\n\nWith respect to the demand curve, there are several key points need to be concerned.\n(1)It is the change in price that causes the change in quantity demanded, not the other way around. In other words, price is an independent variable, while quantity demanded is a dependent variable.  However, as can be seen in fig8-1, price is plotted on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, which is exactly contrary to the common situation in mathematics where independent variable is plotted on x-axis and dependent variables is plotted on the y-axis. Why? There is no special reason, just because Marshall, who invented the demand curve, plotted price on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, which is followed by all economists, thus becomes a convention.\n(2) Price is an observable fact, but strictly speaking, it is not the nominal price or monetary price, but the relative price or real price expressed in other goods. For example, suppose there are two goods: a cell phone and a bottle of water. The cell phone is 1000 RMB and the bottle of water is 1 RMB, which are all monetary prices (nominal prices). The real price of the cell phone should be 1000 bottles of water, and that of one bottle of water is 1/1000 cell phone. As mentioned in Lecture 6, in price theory (or so-called microeconomics) there is only barter without money, so the price of one good is the relative price expressed by another good. Or although there is money, the value of money is stable, so the monetary price is not out of line with the real price. However, if the value of money is unstable, the monetary price will be out of line with the real price. For example, if the monetary price of a cell phone rises to 2000 RMB and that of a bottle of water to 2 RMB, their relative price is still 1000 bottles of water for one cell phone or 1/1000 cell phone for one bottle of water. In other words, the real price has not changed, only the money devalues which means there is inflation. Price theory does not study the influence of money, so the price in it refers to relative prices (real prices).\n(3) Quantity demanded is not an observable fact, but individual's intention, and is different from quantity of purchase which is a fact. Strictly speaking, the law of demand says, “Ceteris paribus, people tend to buy less when price rise, and vice versa. Whether this (psychological) tendency leads to real purchase depends on some specific constraints. Moreover, if quantity demanded is also a fact, the two variables of the demand curve are both facts. Applying the law of demand to explain phenomena is using a fact to explain another fact, which is not allowed by the methodology of science.\n"},"Lecture08/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Ceteris Paribus","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Ceteris Paribus\nThere is “ceteris paribus” at the very beginning of the law of demand. Why? Because there are in fact many factors that affect quantity demanded, not just price. For example, preference and income are also factors that can affect quantity demanded. If one prefers to apple, he will tend to buy apples even at higher price. Or even if the price of apples remains unchanged, with higher income, one will usually tend to buy more apples. However, the law of demand focuses on the relationship between price and quantity demanded, so it is necessary to assume that other factors other than price, which may also cause changes in quantity demanded, remain unchanged, in order to separate the influence of price on quantity demanded. In some economic literatures, the variables studied by the theory or model are called endogenous variables, while the other factors that are not studied but also affect the dependent variables are called exogenous variables.\n “Ceteris paribus” is very important, so it needs to be discussed in detail. Firstly, the law of demand assumes “Ceteris paribus”, which is not like the postulate of selfish-interest which does not need to be proved, not allowed to be questioned, and will never change. Assumption is different from postulate, and is a prerequisite of the application of a theory. If the prerequisite of a theory has not been satisfied, even the prediction of the theory is inconsistent with the fact, it is wrong to claim that the theory is refuted by the fact. It is not the fault of the theory, but of those who wrongly apply the theory.\nFor example, suppose there is a vendor sitting by the street and selling umbrellas for 10 RMB. One day it suddenly rained, and he raised the price to 20 RMB. However, more umbrellas were sold out on that day. Does it refute the law of demand? Of course not, it is the weather as other factor that has changed. There is a series of specific other factors, including the sunny day, behind the demand curve corresponding to the price of 10 RMB. If it is rainy day, this other factor has changed, and the original demand curve of sunny day will no longer apply. Another new demand curve should take the place.\nSuppose that D1 in Fig. 8-2 is the demand curve of umbrella in sunny days and D2 in rainy days. Behind D2 there is a series of specific other factors which are the same as the initial D1 except the “weather” changing from sunny days to rainy days. This new demand curve is obtained by moving the initial one parallel to the right, because at each price level, the quantity demanded corresponding to the D2 is higher than that corresponding to the D1. For example, when the price is P, the quantity demanded corresponding to the D1 is Q1 and that corresponding to the D2 is Q2, which shows that at every price level, due to the influence of rain, the quantity demanded for umbrellas is higher than in sunny days.\n\n  \n\nFigure 8-2\n\nThose who neglect the prerequisite of the law of demand are wrong in directly connecting the point A and point B as a demand curve which slopes upwards. There must be prerequisites for any theory, which is also a part of the theory itself. Take an example in mathematics: when we say 1+1=2, there is an implicit prerequisite of decimal system, but if binary system is actually applied, such as for computers, this calculation is wrong.\nTherefore, the difference between “quantity demanded” and “demand” should be paid attention to. Geometrically, quantity demanded refers to the point on a specific demand curve, so the change in it means the point moving along the same demand curve. And demand refers to the whole demand curve, so the change in demand means the whole curve moving or the point jumping from one demand curve to another.\nMany may think: hey, isn't it obvious? How can anyone make such a stupid mistake? Is it necessary to expound in such detail? However in reality, there are so many economists who make such mistakes, because the changes in other factors are sometimes not so easy as that of changing from sunny days to rainy days in previous example of umbrellas.\nThere was a big debate in economics of China about whether the demand curve could slope upwards which was dubbed as “the demand curve getting its tail up”. Those who advocated that the demand curve could slope upwards are not only ignorant to economics but also to the methodology of science. The law of demand is the axiom of economics, which is the same as the postulate in that it does not need to be proved and must be accepted. If one does not accept the axiom, please get out and establish a new “economics with demand curve sloping upwards”. What’s more, it is not allowed to advocate that the demand curve sometimes slopes downwards and sometimes upwards, because it will make the law of demand become irrefutable tautology which seems to be able to explain everything but in fact explain nothing at all. When the fact is in favor of supporting the demand sloping downwards, it is convenient to say that now the demand curve sloping downwards apply, and vice versa. As a result, it is always true and impossible to be refuted by facts, but just becomes unscientific.\nHowever, those who advocated that the demand curve could slope upwards argued that they had observed phenomena refuting the law of demand law or the demand curve sloping upwards. Really? Let's take three typical examples given by them, and judge by the law of demand.\nThe first example came from a post on an economics forum of a famous university when the debate was hot. The poster said that he saw with his own eyes a clothing store where a skirt was priced 20 RMB but could not be sold out, while later, when the price was increased to 200RMB, it was quickly sold out. Did it refute the law of demand? Of course not. But why? Because some other factors had changed. But what were they? It may not be so obvious in reality.\nThe answer is that other factors here are information costs. The buyer of the skirt certainly did not know that it had been priced 20RMB. If he knew and did not buy when it was priced 20RMB but chose to buy when it was priced 200RMB, his behaviors really refuted the law of demand, which exactly implies that the law of demand is refutable and scientific theory instead of tautology, because it can present the refutable condition. The poster must know that the same skirt had been priced 20RMB before, which meant his information cost was lower, so he would not buy it. He wrongly regarded the buyer’s information cost the same as his, or wrongly regarded the buyer’s demand curve the same as his, so was wrong in directly connecting the point on his demand curve and that on the buyer’s demand curve to form a so-called demand curve sloping upwards.\nThis example needs to be further explained. With information costs which is one kind of transaction costs, consumers are generally not so good at judging the quality of goods in the market as producers, so they adopt the strategy of “judging quality by price” to reduce the relevant information costs. Generally the better the quality is, the higher the price is, which means quality is also a kind of other factors, there are different demand curves for better-quality goods and poorer-quality ones. Thus consumers tend to think that higher-priced goods are of better-quality. However, some sellers will make use of this strategy of “judging quality by price” of consumers to deceive them by deliberately setting a higher price for poor-quality goods. Of course, in the long run, market competition will eliminate this deception, because the information about the good will gradually spread which means the information cost will fall over time. It takes time for consumers to know the truth, which implies there are information costs. For a while, due to the constraint of information cost, some consumers were deceived into thinking that the skirt priced 200RMB was of better-quality than those priced 20RMB.\nThere are two reasons for the demand of the skirt increased after the rise in price. Firstly, the buyer did not know the skirt had been priced 20RMB before, and misjudged the quality of it by the price of 200RMB. Secondly, the demand curve for the skirts of better-quality priced 200RMB is located to the right of that for the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB. In other words, the demand, instead of quantity demanded, for the skirts of better-quality priced 200RMB is greater than that for the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB. As long as one of the above two conditions is not satisfied, the phenomenon seen by the poster will not occur. Take the poster himself for example: he knew the skirt had been priced 20RMB, so he would never misjudge the quality of it. Or if the skirt was priced 20,000RMB, consumers would doubt if a skirt of such top quality would be sold in a small store, so would not be so easily deceived. Even if some consumers were deceived to buy, the demand for the skirts of such “top-quality” would generally be lower than that of the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB.\nNext is the second example which came from an economist: the tuition of MBA (Master of Business Administration) was increasing year by year, but more and more applied for it. Did it refute the law of demand? Again of course not, and again because some other factors had changed which caused the demand curve of MBA to move to the right. It is logically similar to the above example of umbrellas, so Fig. 8-2 can be directly used to explain it.\nWhat other factors had changed in this example? It is not so simple as the example of skirts just now. Only when you have a deeper understanding of the reality can you find out the key. Firstly, MBA was new to many at the very beginning, and few knew it well and did not know whether it was worth its tuition much higher than that of ordinary master degrees in business, so most would just wait and see, and few would try to apply. It is also due to the constraint information costs.  However, people gradually got to know MBA over time, thus increased the demand for it, which meant the fall in information costs had moved the demand curve for MBA to right. Secondly, the network of interpersonal connections is very important in doing business. Relatives, friends, fellows from the same town or province, classmates ... all can shorten the distance between people and are helpful for business. The majority of MBA students are businessmen, so it is certainly a good opportunity for them to form a network of classmates. In other words, MBA is to some extent similar to golfing. The value of education (or sports) in fact is not the most important, while it is much more important that it is a social platform for specific circle of people to form a network. With more and more students applying MBA, the value or the quality of MBA as a social platform was increasing, so its demand curve had moved to right.\nTo sum up, economics is usually not very difficult, but the application is rather difficult because we must have an in-depth and detailed understanding of the reality. Otherwise, only the prerequisite of “ceteris paribus” is enough to confuse many economic students and even economists. That’s because they do not have a good grasp of the law of demand, but also because they do not have enough knowledge of the reality.\n"},"Lecture08/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Explanation of “Buying on the upswing, Selling on the downswing” in the Stock Market","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Explanation of “Buying on the upswing, Selling on the downswing” in the Stock Market\nLast is the third example. There is a jargon called “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” in the stock market, which means investors tend to buy in when the stock price is up, while tend to sell out when the stock price is down. It seems that the more expensive, the more selling, and vice versa. Does it refute the law of demand? Again of course not. But why? Those who choose to buy a stock must expect that the stock price will rise, so the current price is lower than the expected future price, and vice versa. There are even no other factors that have changed in this phenomenon which just directly proves the law of demand.\nWhat really makes an investor decide whether to buy in or sell out is not whether the current price is high or low, but whether the current price is higher or lower than the expected future price. Investors adopt the strategy of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” not because they tend to buy the more expensive stocks and sell the cheaper ones, but the rising price is usually easier to make them expect the price will continue to rise and decide to buy, and vice versa.\nHowever, if the rising price of a stock will only lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise, will it rise endless? It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock. Obviously there are not such things in reality? In reality, the rising price of a stock does not necessarily lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise. When the price rises to a certain level, some will begin to doubt if it has reached the peak, and reverse to sell out to take profits. The higher the price, the more expectations will be reversed. When the number of investors who reverse to sell out exceeds that of those who expect the price will continue to rise, the market will suddenly reverse. It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock.\nThe problem in explaining of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” is that the constraint of rising or falling price of a stock is not enough to determine investors’ behaviors. In other words, with this constraint alone, we cannot reliably predict what investors will behave (decide). The key factor to determine the behaviors in the stock market is actually expectation. However, expectation is a kind of psychological activity, which is like self-interest and quantity demanded as motives and intentions, and cannot be directly used to explain phenomena. Psychological factors or activities are not observable, so cannot be tested by facts, which will make the explanation irrefutable and become tautology.\nThere are two solutions: one is to add observable constraints, which is the solution to deal with self-interest and quantity demanded (as will be explained later, price is the observable constraint); the other is to replace psychological factors with observable constraints, which is precisely the solution to deal with expectation. It is impossible to observe what one expects in his mind, but it is possible to observe the objective factors that form the expectations. For example, the implementation of a policy beneficial to a company will make investors expect the price of the company's stock to rise. In principle, if one can know all the objective factors (constraints) that form investors’ expectations in the stock market, he can accurately predict whether the stock price will rise or fall, how much it will, and when it will. However, it is too difficult, in fact is impossible, to get to know all these constraints, which implies there is serious information cost (transaction cost). What is even more troublesome is that even if the information about the relevant constraints is available, they are changing every minute. Even one can know the relevant constraints for this moment, they may have changed the next minute, so the formation about them soon become useless and new information needs to be collected again.\nThis is the characteristic of the stock market (in fact, all financial markets). There are not only many key constraints, but also they change rapidly which means after they change for once, they will change again in a short time. It is different from the usual decision-making in other fields where there are relatively less key constraints and they are more stable which means after they change for once, they will not change again for a long time. Is the stock market or stock price predictable? The answer is: yes, and no. Yes, because if one can quickly and accurately get to know all the key information, by applying the law of demand, it is enough to predict precisely. No, because in fact no one can get to know all the key information quickly and accurately. There is a school called “technical analysis” based on the charts of stock prices in the past (such as K lines) to guess the future trend. This so-called analysis actually assumes implicitly that “what happened in the past will continue to happen in the future” which has nothing to do with science. From the perspective of science, what happened in the past is based on some specific constraints, and what will happen in the future is based on other specific constraints. Why must these two sets of constraints be the same? No logic or facts can support this assumption. Remind: assumption is different from postulate in that it must be consistent with facts. Due to the too high information costs of getting to know the key constraints, some investors choose to guess based on the constraints in the past, which is understandable (explainable), but there is no reliable scientific basis for such guesses.\nThere are many complicated mathematical models in current finance. However, no matter how complicated the mathematics is, it cannot save the theories with wrong assumption. Mathematics can only ensure that the deduction from the assumption to the conclusion is logically correct, but cannot ensure that the assumption itself is correct. There is an idiom in China that if one go in the wrong direction, the faster he goes, the farther away he will be from his destination.\nStrictly speaking, the financial market is difficult to predict, not because the financial theories are very complicated (as mentioned previously, the law of demand is sufficient), but because it is too difficult to get to know the key constraints. It is irrelevant to overcome this difficulty by applying very complicated mathematics. However, not only economics is helpless for the financial market, but physics is also helpless in some cases because the relevant constraints are too difficult to get to know. The most typical case is that physics cannot predict the outcome of gambling. Take the simplest coin toss as an example. As long as a physicist can accurately and quickly get to know all the relevant constraints such as the force of throwing, gravity, air friction, winds force, etc., he is sure to predict which side of the coin will face up by applying Newton's law. However, because the duration of the coin being thrown up and then falling down is too short, the physicist cannot get to know all the relevant constraints in time. All he can do is to calculate the probability of which side facing up in many tosses (50% for the positive and 50% for the negative), instead of predicting which side facing up at a specific time. In fact, all a financial economist can do is also to calculate the probability of a certain status, but the happening of small probability event can never be ruled out, and it is most horrible or even deadly which is called “black swan event” in the stock market.\nFrom this comparison with physics, it is obvious that the short duration of constraints is the most critical difficulty. The constraints are short-term, which not only means that economists and physicists are unable to get to know all the key constraints in time, but also the information about the constraints quickly expire even if they manage to know. By contrast, insurance, which belongs to finance, also relies on probability, but not influenced by short duration. What’s more, although there are also many complicated constraints in the investments in business, real estate, antique art, etc. other than in the financial market, neither is there the difficult of short duration of constraints. Therefore, economics as a science cannot predict the short-term fluctuations in financial markets, just as physics as a science cannot predict the results of gambling. Anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the stock market is a liar, because it is the same as anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the casino is a liar.\nSome may be still keep asking: if economics cannot predict the financial market, why are there so many securities analysts? And why are there so many people who spend money in enquiring them for forecasts about the stock market? Firstly, those who analyze based on the fundamentals of the companies and public news or inside stories actually investigate the long-term constraints. Of course, the key constraints that will influence the stock price cannot be only long-term ones, so such predictions based on the long-term constraints are helpless for short-term fluctuations. Secondly, as mentioned above, the school of so-called “technical analysis” does not investigate the relevant constraints, but only guess the future according to the past. In addition to the unscientific problem just pointed out, there is also the mistake of “explaining fact with fact” criticized by Marshall. However, this school in the financial market is not the only one who makes money by guessing. Fortune telling is the much older profession of the same nature. There have been always so many people who are willing to pay fortune tellers. What they buy may be just a peace of mind.\nBy the way, Burton Malkiel, a scholar of USA in his popular book “A random walk on Wallstreet” mocked that the return rate of the stock portfolio selected by a monkey with blinders randomly throwing darts would be almost the same as that of the stock portfolio recommended by securities analysts. In order to test this mock, a British magazine “Observe” held a stock-picking competition in 2012 among three teams: one is a cat, one is a group of securities analysts, and the other is a group of middle-school students. The result is that the cat did beat the other two groups of human by totally random selection.\n"},"Lecture08/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Selection of Other Factors –Methodology of Science (2): Occam’s Razor","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Selection of Other Factors –Methodology of Science (2): Occam’s Razor\nThere are more complicated issues to discuss about “other factors.” What on earth are the “other factors?” If “other factors” are any factors other than the price, then the question arises: if any factors other than the price remain unchanged, how can price change? What causes the price to change? So it is actually not simple for “other factors”. Some other factors cannot change, but it is wrong that any factors other than the price cannot change. In other words, other factors should be divided into two categories: changeable and unchangeable ones. Next we will analyze which other factors are unchangeable, and which are as changeable as the price.\nThere are three kinds of other factors. The first kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in demand, and they are unchangeable. As mentioned in the previous examples, weather (which directly affects the demand for umbrellas), information, quality (which directly affects the demand for clothes, MBA, etc.) and income are all unchangeable.\nThe second kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in price, and they must be changeable, because if they do not change, neither will the price change. For example, when it comes to the end of season, the price of off-season clothes will be cut dramatically in clearance sale for funds returning. The qualities of the clothes have not changed, and the buyers also have sufficient information, so they will rush to do shopping. It is precisely the implication of the law of demand! Other factors such as seasonal promotion directly affect the price, so they must be allowed to change.\nThe third kind of other factors is called “intermediate factors”, because they will be caused to change by the change in price, and then their changes will affect the demand. For example, the rise in the price of petrol will, on the one hand, make people buy less petrol (i.e. the demand for petrol drops), but it will also make people buy less cars because one does not need petrol if one does not have a car. Petrol and car are always used together, so the rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to the drop (or rise) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Complements”. The characteristic of complements is that the price of one commodity is inversely related to the demand for the other. The drop in the demand for cars will lead to a drop in the price of cars, which can be explained by the TSD introduced in later lecture and can be understood even with common sense. As car is a supplement to petrol, the drop in the price of cars will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for petrol.\nAnother example: the rise in the price of pork will, on the one hand, make people buy less pork (i.e. the demand for pork will drop), but people still want to eat meat, so they eat chicken instead. Pork and chicken are substitutable in consumption, so a rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to a rise (or drop) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Substitutes”. The characteristic of substitutes is that the price of one commodity is positively related to the demand for the other. The rise in the demand for chicken will lead to a rise in the price of chicken. As chicken is a substitute to pork, the rise in the price of chicken will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for pork.\nAs seen from the above two examples, the change in price of a commodity will lead to the change in demand and price of its supplements and substitutes which will in turn affect the demand of this commodity, so they are the “intermediate factors.” Such intermediate factors must be allowed to change. Why? Because there are not only a large number of intermediate factors, but there are also complex and subtle relationships with the goods analyzed. It is difficult to investigate whether they remain unchanged in reality. Take a real example in marketing. There was once a very successful chocolate advertisement in Britain, which attracted many middle school students. It was thought that only the sales of other candies and snacks would be affected because chocolate is obviously a substitute to them. Unexpectedly, even the sales of games dropped dramatically. After investigation, it was found that the pocket money of middle school students was basically a fixed amount, so when they bought more chocolate, they had to cut their spending on games as well as other candies and snacks. Game makers never thought that chocolate would become their competitor. In other words, any two seemingly unrelated commodities in this world will become substitutes or supplements under certain constraints. Therefore, if intermediate factors are not allowed to change, once one finds that the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts, one can always blame on the change of intermediate factors. However, it is difficult to investigate whether intermediate factors have actually changed, thus the law of demand will easily “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.\nFrom the above explanation on the three kinds of other factors, please pay attention to two key points. Firstly, that the first kind of other factors cannot change does not mean that they can really never change, but that they must remain unchanged on the same demand curve. If such other factors have changed in reality, we must draw another new demand curve. This key point has already been stressed before that “ceteris paribus” is an assumption which is not the same as the postulate of “self-interest”. The postulate will never change and is always regarded as true unconditionally. However, the assumption is a prerequisite for the application of a theory, and it may not be true. It is true only when it is consistent with the facts, and then can the theory be applied.\nSecondly, as mentioned before, there are other factors such as preference, income, etc. that affect the demand besides price. However, “preference” (as well as taste, like, and other similar expressions) should be specifically singled out. It does affect the demand, but one must assume that it will never change not only on the same demand curve, but also on different demand curves! Why? Because preference is a psychological factor, and not an objective fact that is observable.  If it is allowed to change, again one can always blame on the change of preference whenever the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts. The psychological change is not observable by others, thus the law of demand will again “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.\nTake the previous example of umbrella, with the rise of the price, there are still more umbrellas sold out, which is explained by the change of objective fact (other factors) that the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy one. However, it can also be explained by the change of psychological factor that umbrellas are preferred now than before. Although the effect of these two explanations is the same: to draw another new demand curve (both factors directly affect the demand and cause the whole demand curve move), the former explanation can be tested by looking up to see if it is really raining, but how can the latter explanation be tested? Who knows if umbrellas are more preferred now than before. In fact, it is logically similar to that economics forbids using the postulate of sometimes self-interest and sometimes un-self-interest to explain phenomena.\nTo extend the above analysis, the statement that a person’s preference remains unchanged is logically equivalent to the statement that different persons have the same preference. In other words, it is forbidden in economics to use different preferences of different persons to explain their different behaviors. It is said that the Mongolian with much less income than Chinese consume much more than Chinese. It is easy to think that it is because the Mongolian and the Chinese have different consumerism, which is not a scientific explanation. Why the Mongolian has the consumerism different from the Chinese is itself a phenomenon that needs to be explained. In brief, such psychological factors as preference habit, custom, nationality and etc. cannot be used to explain phenomena, but are phenomena to be explained. It is objective facts (constraints) behind these factors that can be used to make a refutable explanation.\nIt is somewhat similar to the previous discussions of expectation and intermediate factor. Intermediate factor is fact, but the change of it is too complicated to investigate, so it is better to let it change. Expectation and preference are the same in that they both belong to psychological factors which are not facts, and they should be replaced by the objective factors (constraints). In other words, the psychological factors are assumed to be unchanged, and it is the objective factors replacing them that change.\nTake the previous example of umbrella again. One explanation is that because the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy day, the whole demand curve for umbrellas moves. Another explanation is that because the umbrellas are preferred more in a rainy day than in a sunny day.  However, preference is a psychological factor. In order to avoid the mistake of tautology, we should further look for objective factors (constraints) that cause this psychology. It is obvious that umbrellas can protect one better from adverse weather in a rainy day (one will get wet in rains without an umbrella, and has a greater chance of getting sick). Rain and illness are objective factors that can be tested by investigating the facts. Thus, the psychological factors that are not facts can be replaced by the logically related objective factors that are facts, and we can avoid the mistake of tautology.\nBoth of the above explanations are refutable and scientific. Obviously, the latter explanation is too long-winded. Here we introduce more requirements for methodology of science: a scientific theory should be not only refutable, but also the simpler the better. In science, there are also competitions among different theories, and there are two competition criteria to decide which one is the winner. The first criterion is “explanatory power” which means the ability to explain as many phenomena as possible without being refuted by facts). It is the theory with the strongest explanatory power that is the winner. If more than one theory can explain the same amount of phenomena, which means their explanatory powers are the same, now it is the second criterion of “simplicity” decide the winner. It is the simpler theory that is the winner. This second criterion in methodology of science is called “Ockham's Razor” because it was proposed by William of Occam (1287–1347), a logician and Franciscan friar from the 13th to 14th centuries. “Occam’s Razor” says “do not multiply entities without necessity”, while the common expression is “the simpler theory, the better.”\nIt is necessary to discuss again the competition between Heliocentric and Geocentric in astronomy. In fact, Copernicus did not intend to reject but to improve Geocentric originally. With the development of astronomical observation technology, more and more phenomena that seem to refute Geocentric are discovered, which means Geocentric cannot explain those phenomena. When a theory is refuted by facts, scientists will not immediately abandon it and start to establish a new one, but try to amend and improve the existing theory. Astronomers at that time (including Copernicus) also did so by constantly adding new contents to Geocentric to explain the newly discovered astronomical phenomena. So Geocentric had not really been refuted at that time, but the problem is that it had become more and more complex which was not consistent with “Occam’s Razor”. If there are no other theories that can explain as many astronomical phenomena as it, astronomers can only endure the increasing complexity of Geocentric and continue to accept it. However, Copernicus observed that, unlike the distance between the earth and other stars would change, the distance between the earth and the sun almost never changes. Logically, there are only two possibilities: either the earth is stationary and the sun revolves around it, which is what Geocentric advocates, or the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it. As the Geocentric became more and more complex, Copernicus changed his thinking: What if the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it? Once this assumption was changed, he found that the explanation of the movements of various stars suddenly became extremely simple -- much simpler than Geocentric! Although all the movements of stars observed at that time could be explained by both Geocentric and Heliocentric, the latter is much simpler, so “Occam’s Razor” cut off Geocentric. In other words, strictly speaking, Geocentric was not refuted by facts in Copernicus era, but replaced by Heliocentric that is simpler with the same (or even stronger) explanatory power. It was not until Galileo's era that the phase of Venus was observed and Geocentric was definitely refuted.\nTherefore, it is not a tautology to use preference to explain phenomena if the objective factors that cause preference is further found, but it is better to directly use those objective factors as explanation.\nThrough the above detailed discussion, it is hoped that the readers have not only learned the specific knowledge about the law of demand, but also further understood the “refutability” and “Occam’s Razor” in methodology of science.\n"},"Lecture08/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Role of the Law of Demand as An axiom","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Role of the Law of Demand as An axiom\nWhat is the relationship between other factors in the law of demand and the constraints mentioned before? In reality, human’s behavior (choice) is constrained by many factors. Think of Rousseau's words: Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains. If the so-called chains need a clear definition, they are constraints. There is such thing as unconstrained situation, so neither is there is such things as unconstrained freedom.\nFrom the point of view of economics, self-interest is the most important restriction on human’s behavior, but it is a postulate which needs not to be true. Only self-interest is not enough to constrain human’s behavior. It has been pointed out in Lecture 4 that if there were no scarcity, human would not need to choose even if they were self-interested. There are also constraints that restrict human’s behavior along with self-interest. Constraints are objective facts which are essentially different from self-interest. It is the unchanged postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. However, there may be tens of thousands of constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. It is impossible and unnecessary for economics to care about all of them. Only some of constraints need to be singled out to analyze which is called endogenous variables (such as price in the law of demand), while other constraints should be treated as exogenous variables (other factors).\nIt has been repeatedly stressed that it is the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that are used to explain phenomena in economics, which is precisely the law of demand. The price in the law of demand is a fact, so if widely interpreted, it can be regarded as constraint. Quantity demanded is individual’s intention, so it is a psychological factor, not a fact. There is a negative correlation between price and quantity demanded, or the demand curve slopes downwards, which implies the postulate of self-interest. That is why in economics the demand curve must slope downwards and no exceptions are allowed (no demand curve can slope upwards), because if there were exceptions, it would be inconsistent with the postulate of self-interest.\nThus, the law of demand is not only a theory which can only explain the consumers’ choices in the product market, but also an axiom of economics, and has strong explanatory power. Price can be regarded as constraint, so any constraint that plays a key role in determining the behavior to be explained can be put into the law of demand as price. When there is more than one key constraint, but just one of them is singled out to analyze, the other constraints will be regarded as “other factors” to keep unchanged. In fact, all the phenomena that have been explained previously with the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints can be rewritten with the law of demand. The law of demand may not be mentioned literally, but it has actually been always applied and followed in any explanation or analysis in economics. And only such economic explanation or analysis is correct when it is consistent with the law of demand, the axiom of economics.\n"}}}
