1: Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 1: Introduction\nBefore the study of economics, it is necessary to remind readers that never believe the ordinary textbooks of economics without thinking.\nIn general, textbooks are the truth. However, it is not the case for economics. There are many mistakes in the books of economics.\nWhy? Because economics is too young.\nLet me introduce the history of Economics. A question: when was USA independent? The answer: in 1776. It is the same year that a British named Adam Smith (1723-1790) published his book “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,” which marked the birth of economics. So Adam Smith is the founder of economics. Students and the researchers of economics, including you and me, are his disciples.\nSo you can see how young economics is, just like the USA that is only 200 years old. It is no wonder that there are lots of mistakes in economics. \nNatural science, such as physics, is regarded as truth. However, don't forget that Aristotle started to study it thousands of years ago. It has been developing for thousands of years. There had also been many mistakes in physics. For example, physicists believed that the falling speed of an object was correlating with its mass, which is totally wrong. The falling rate of a stone is faster than the plume’s just because the air friction interferes in. Another example is astronomy. How long had erroneous Geocentric been dominant in astronomy?\nSo it is not a surprise that there are many mistakes in economics because it is only 200 years old. It is a surprise that we entirely believe economics textbooks without thinking. In fact, many authors of economics textbooks do not take all that they write in books for granted. However, textbooks are not academic work, so it is better to follow the majority. Nevertheless, truth is often in the hand of the minority.\nHowever, I decided to write a textbook on economics which does not follow the majority. I will select only the correct contents from ordinary textbooks of economics, criticize the mistakes and add something new and correct. Therefore, this book looks somewhat different from the usual textbooks of economics.\nSomeone would doubt whether the truth is subject to my judgment. How can we know the truth objectively? We need an assistant: Methodology of Science (MS) or Philosophy of Science which provides an objective analysis of whether a subject is a science. It applies not only for economics but also for all kinds of sciences. The scholars of MS establish the rules of science form the practice of natural science. So it makes one significant distinction between ordinary textbooks and this book that there are many introductions of MS in this book. In my opinion, the best way to master MS for those who are not the students of philosophy or logics is to learn economics.\nBesides, this book is suitable for both students major in economics and amateurs. There is some math in this book for the economics students to study, while for beginners, math is not essential, though understanding it does help to understand economics better. But you do not need to be anxious if you cannot understand the math in this book, because the application of economics does not rely on math.\nThis textbook inherits the academic discipline from “Economics Explanation” by Steven N.G Cheung. The references of traditional economics textbook are mainly from “Theory of Price and Application” written by Cheung’s teacher Jack Hirshleifer (1925-2005). Cheung wrote a preface “The Experience of Learning -- Preface for My Teacher’s Textbook” for its Chinese version translated by Zhou Yan and me. In the preface, He suggested that students read the “Theory of Price and Application” with critical thinking instead of belief. It is more important to raise questions and discuss with classmates or teachers. That is the real study!\nI would like to share these words with all the readers of this book as an encouragement!\n\f\n"},"Lecture02/":{"url":"Lecture02/","title":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 2: Economics is a Social Science\nEconomics is a social science, which is the subject nature of it. However, what does it mean? This lecture will explain it with the methodologies of science.\n"},"Lecture02/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture02/Section01.html","title":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability","keywords":"","body":"Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability1\nEconomics is a science. Science is an activity of human intelligence. It starts from one or several postulates or axioms from which a set of theories and inferences are established as a system. Besides, all the conclusions of this theoretical system must be tested by fact.\nThis definition of “Science” can be divided into three stages also known as “Trilogy of Science”.\nThe first stage is postulates and axioms, which is the starting point of science. It does not need proof; neither needs to be true; it just needs to be accepted without any doubts. Sceptics doubt everything including those as a starting point. But what can be done without a starting point?\nThe second stage is a logical deduction. Mathematics as a tool assisting logical deduction may be useful for science. However, Math is not science itself, but a useful tool for the second stage of science.\nThe third stage is the fact test, which makes the distinction between science and math: there are only the previous two stages in math (Geometry is a typical instance). Without this third stage, math is not science. Since the first stage of science needs no proof and does not allow any doubts, it seems very arbitrary and even unreasonable. Then how can be it sure to be OK? That is why science needs the support of fact in the third stage.\nIt is the third stage that distinguishes science from math. Therefore, an essential feature of science is not provability, but refutability. That is, fact can refute it2.\nThere is a serious and rather common misunderstanding about science that should be clarified. The public usually presumes that science is equivalent to truth. This is a misconception as they are totally different. A statement with refutability is scientific; otherwise, it is non-scientific. The false is the refuted but the truth is not the unrefuted. Therefore, it is not contradictory to say science is false and non-science is true.\nLet us consider this example of unscientific truth: a four-footed animal has four feet. It is impossible to find a fact to refute this statement, which means it is absolutely true. However, what is irrefutable is exactly unscientific. Think about it deeply; why is that the statement cannot be falsified or refuted? Because the former part of it just repeats the latter part. In other words, A is B, so B is A. Such un-scientific, but true statement is called tautology which means repetition. Human study science in order to discover new knowledge, but tautology does not add any new knowledge; instead, it only repeats what already established. That is why tautology is absolutely true but becomes unscientific.\nTautology is not the only case of irrefutable statements. There are also four kinds of unscientific statements: unreality, ambiguity, contradiction and unrestrained.\nThe statement of “God exists.” is unscientific; instead, it is associated more with religion. The question here is why so? This is because the concept of God is not a fact, and it cannot be tested by facts, which leads to irrefutability.\nSeen from another point of view, the concept “God” is ambiguous, which also leads to irrefutability. Superstition, which is somewhat similar to religion, tries to avoid being refuted with ambiguity. \nHere is a story: Three students go to take an important public examination. They meet a fortune-teller on the road, so ask him to predict their examination results. The fortune-teller just raises a finger and says nothing. \nPossible outcomes: If one of them passes the examination, that one-finger means one succeeds. If two of them pass, it means one of them fails. If all of them pass or do not pass, it means they as a group succeed or fail3. Whatever the result will be, the fortune-teller can redefine the ambiguous meaning of the one-finger to make sure he is always right. However, it is unscientific precisely because it is irrefutable.\nThe statement of “There is a black point on an all-white wall.” is also unscientific. With this contradiction, the conclusion of “The wall is a god” will be deducted. Is it only an omnipotent god who can be both black and white?\nIn a math class at middle schools, they teach that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, only a few know that it is also the way of testing science.\n If “A ⇒ B” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” instead of “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”should be used. \nBy analogy if “A ⇒ B and C” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” and “not (C) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. If “A ⇒ B, C, D…” is tested, because there are limitless propositions deduced from A, the test about A are endless, and become irrefutable. It is not easy to find a simple case to illustrate this situation of unrestrained, which will be pointed out when it occurs.\n“Scientific faults” are refutable statements and have been refuted by facts. For example; there are two conflicting theories of Heliocentric and Geocentric on the relationship between sun and earth.\nWhich of them is true? How to test them? Copernicus argued that if Heliocentric were true, then Venus would be waxing and waning like the moon, which is \"A ⇒ B\" where A is Heliocentric, and B is the Venus' phase. So the test condition for this statement is that if the Venus were not waxing and waning, Heliocentric would be false, which is \"not (A) ⇒ not (B)\". Heliocentric can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. On the other hand, Geocentric can also present its refutable condition: if the Venus were waxing and waning, Geocentric would be false, so it is scientific too. Afterwards, Galileo observed with a telescope, found that the Venus does be waxing and waning, which refuted Geocentric and supported Heliocentric. Then Geocentric is scientifically false because it has been reputed though it is reputable. By contrast, Heliocentric is not only refutable but also true, because the observation of Galileo does not refute it. \"Reputability\" is the characteristic of science, while \"Refuted\" is the end of false theories, which should not be confused with each other.\nThus human observes the reality, exact the laws out of facts, then make up science theories which can be used to explain what has happened and predict what will happen. If the explanations and predictions have not been refuted by facts, then theories can be accepted as true. But if they are refuted, the theories need to be revised, or even abandoned entirely.\nThe example of Heliocentric illustrates that the theories accepted as true are not true. More accurately speaking, they are just not refuted for now, which does not mean that they will never be refuted in the future, because they are always refutable in science. In fact, with the development of Astronomy, Heliocentric theory has been revised from the idea that all planets, including the Earth, move around the Sun from the centric orbits to the oval orbits. Now the heliocentric theory has been abandoned and replaced by the theory of cosmic expansion because the sun is no longer believed as the center of the Universe.\nLogics also deny that science or refutable theories can be absolutely true. For example, even human has seen thousands of white swans and find no one is black; still, they cannot conclude that there are no black ones in the world. The statement “all swans are white” can be accepted as true, but just for now.\nOf course, only scientifically true theories are desirable, because they can increase human’s knowledge and guide the practice. As mentioned above, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, human firstly tries to explain what has happened to construct theories, then with which predict what will happen by observing if the predictions come true, human test the theories again and again.\nIt seems rather abstract, so let us take examples to illustrate the above interpretation. In Physics, Newton’s laws explain or deduct the phenomenon of an apple falling on the ground. They are accepted as true because we never see an apple flying to the sky. Airplanes that can fly to the sky are invented, which does not violate but apply Newton’s laws. As long as the conditions required by Newton’s laws are satisfied, airplanes never fall from the sky, which proves the laws are true. \nSo, why is Economics scientific?\nEconomics is a set of systematic theories deduced from a postulate which is “human are all self-interested”, and an axiom which is the Law of Demand. Economics can be used to explain some phenomena that cannot be explained by Physics. For example, there is a $100 bill in a public place. Physics can explain why it is gone with the wind. However, it cannot explain why the bill is still gone without wind which only can be explained by economics.\nThe Theory of Supply and Demand (TSD) introduced in later lectures argues that the price will rise if the demand exceeds the supply, while the price will fall if the supply exceeds the demand. As long as the conditions required by the TSD are satisfied, it has never been refuted. If the government imposes price control, forbidding sellers to increase prices when the demand exceeds supply, it seems that the price does not rise, but it does in the other form, such as the time spent on queuing and the red pockets paid as bribe. The logic is similar to the fact of airplanes flying to the sky does not violate Newton’s laws. So, it just proves that the TSD is true again. \n\n\n1. This section introduces the key points of MS.

What is the difference? Physics studies matter, while economics studies human, which is the fundamental difference.\nWhy is it a fundamental difference? Because economists are human too! In other words, economists themselves are also the study objects. Chemistry is a natural science, of which the study object is a molecule, while the studiers are human. What happens if molecules study themselves? Since economists as studiers and their study objects are all human, it causes much trouble. \nFirstly, human has emotion, while science requires objective analysis where subjective emotion should be ruled out. It is easy for natural scientists with the matter as a study object to do so, while rather tricky for social scientists who themselves are also human to rule out their emotions. Economic issues often arouse social disputes with anger. Anger is precisely a kind of emotion which should be ruled out in the discussion of economic issues since economics is a science. Anger can never be used to discuss issues of physics; however, once issues are economical, it is difficult to rule out the emotion of anger! \nSecondly, the postulate of economics is the self-interest of human. Economists are, of course, self-interested too, which cause a severe problem: some economists do not objectively analyze issues with economic theories, but distort their analysis intentionally or unintentionally and make the conclusions beneficial to them. For example, there are many debates on the issue of property prices in China. Different economists have very different opinions. No wonder the public doubt if economics is a science.\nThere is a joke that ten economists would have eleven opinions on the same economic issue. There are three reasons for this weird phenomenon:\n(1) As mentioned in the previous lecture, there are still so many mistakes in economics nowadays. Only wrong conclusions can be made by analysis with wrong theories.\n(2) Economics is rather simple but very difficult to apply. So there is a great distinction between a master and a lame duck. A skillful woodcarver can make a masterpiece out of wood while a clumsy one cannot make anything. Similarly, the second-rate or unqualified economists can only make the wrong conclusion even with correct economic theories.\n(3) It may be the most key reason. As mentioned above, the self-interested economists distort their analysis to make the conclusions most beneficial to them. It is neither because the theories are wrong, nor because they do not understand how to use the theories correctly, but because they need these conclusions beneficial to them.\nNatural science such as physics has the advantage that it can avoid the distortions by self-interest and emotion of human. However, this kind of distortion did occur in the history of the developments of natural science. It may be not well-known that Newton was not a good guy. Historians believe that the fight for the invention of calculus between Newton and Leibniz had postponed the development of mathematics in the UK by at least a century. Besides, he was so narrow-minded that he severely squeezed Hooker, another famous physicist, out.\nThere is a real story in “The Passions of the Mind”, a biography of Freud. When Freud began his career as a psychiatrist, in medicine, there was a wrong thought and people believed that only females would suffer from hysteria because they thought psychosis was only for those with weak willing. Due to this discrimination for female, psychiatrists at that time, never thought about the possibility of male patients. \nHowever, Freud found some cases of male patients of hysteria in the clinic. Napoleon was a patient of hysteria, which showed that hysteria had nothing to do with a weak will and that even males can get hysteria. Nevertheless, at that time, the prejudice for female was so strong that such ridiculous thought was prevalent even though medicine is natural science with the human body instead of a human being as its study object.\nFreud published his finding in an academic paper which caused criticisms and attack on him overwhelmingly. He did not take them seriously but was surprised and upset by the criticism of a massively respected elder in medicine whom he adored. He felt puzzled why the elder who is more experienced than him refused to admit that there were male patients of hysteria. \nDue to the intense criticisms, Freud lost his reputation and even job. Many years later, when the respected elder was dying, he called Freud to his bed and said: “In fact, no one in the world knows more clearly than I that you are right, because I am a male patient of hysteria myself.”\nThe respected elder was not ignorant. Precisely because he knew undoubtedly, he could not accept the truth. If one refuses to accept the truth because of ignorance, he cannot be educated. Nevertheless, if the truth is adverse to his benefits, it is in vain to try to persuade him by reasoning. There is a Chinese saying that a scholar cannot reason with a soldier. That is because the soldier does not intend to reason with him. It is the same for those who want to hide their selfish desires by disguising to reason.\nThus natural science with the matter as study object has the same problem as economics. However, natural science has the advantage that it can do controllable experiments in labs to test theories. Different persons have different interests, so it is usually not easy for natural science is manipulated by a few persons. While the lab of economics is the uncontrollable real world, so it is much easier for few economists to take advantage of the public’s ignorance and the emotion to distort the economic analysis and make conclusions beneficial to them at the expense of the reputation of all economists as a whole.\nThe public is confused to see different economists have such divergent opinions on the same issue hence doubt if economics is a science like physics. It is some economists instead of economics that should carry the blames.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: THE ECOLOGIST, THE ECONOMIST, AND THE STATISTICIAN1\nIn 1990 the ecologist and popular author Paul Ehrlich sent a check for $576.07 to the economist Julian L. Simon. It was a payoff on a bet made 10 years previously. Ehrlich, though not an economist, had made startling economic predictions in his 1968 best-seller The Population Bomb. Take, for example, his opening sentences: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.”\nEhrlich’s predictions utterly failed. Despite an “oil crisis” in mid-decade and again toward the end, overall the 1970s were a decade of remarkable economic growth. Yet the author continued to be highly acclaimed. In books, speeches, and articles that received worldwide attention, he prophesied that accessible supplies of many key minerals would be nearly depleted by 1985.\nMeanwhile the economist Julian L. Simon had been predicting just the reverse for the1970s and1980s: “continuing improvements in human well-being, and lower prices for raw materials. Simon challenged Ehrlich to back his contrary forecast with hard cash, and Ehrlich accepted the challenge. The result was a 1980 bet about whether the prices of five important metals – chrome, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten – would, after allowing for inflation, rise or fall by 1990. The economist let the ecologist choose specific commodities\". Once again, economist Simon was proved right and Ehrlich wrong. The 1980s were also a decade of prosperity, and raw materials prices generally fell. The ecologist had to pay off on the bet.\nEhrlich’s analytic error was to look only at the demand side, and specifically at a growing world population (more mouths to feed). Julian Simon, with his better economic understanding, also considered the supply side. More people mean more mouths, but also more hands and brains. Simon also took account of other favorable economic trends such as greater liberalization of national economies and increased international trade.\nSo the predictions of economic analysis were vindicated. Nevertheless, Paul Ehrlich continued to publish highly popular books forecasting, as mistakenly as before, environmental doom in the near future. Just as regularly, up to his death in 1998 Julian Simon was providing sound analysis and well-validated economic forecasts, culminating in his volume The Ultimate Resource (2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1998). But none of his books was best-sellers.\nWhat was going on here? An economic interpretation might be that these two authors were supplying different commodities. Julian Simon was supplying correct economic analysis. Paul Ehrlich was and is in a different business, somewhat comparable to horror-story writers such as Stephen King. Evidently, at least when it comes to selling books, the demand for horror stories far exceeds the demand for sound economic analysis. [ For a detailed history of the Ehrlich-Simon wager see John Tierney, “Betting the Planet,” New York Times Magazine, December 2, 1990.]\nA later exhaustive and careful study by the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg (The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001) has updated Simon’s results. Initially intending to refute Simon’s analysis, Lomborg found his research instead of confirming it. Despite the rising world population, per capita incomes have maintained their upward trend and real prices of essential resources have continued to fall.\nAs a rather strange sidelight, upon publishing these results, Lomborg became the target of personal attacks that reached an extraordinary level of intensity. At one of his public presentations, a cream pie was dumped on his face and clothing. He was even accused of “intellectual dishonesty” by a scientific body with official standing in Denmark. Ultimately, all the charges were conclusively refuted, and the improperly motivated proceeding against Lomborg was dismissed. (Which does not necessarily mean, of course, that all of Lomborg’s estimates and forecasts will ultimately prove to be correct.)\nOne possible lesson: sound economic analysis can sometimes be riskier than one might think2\n\nThe material above shows that Ehrlich was not an economist, and facts had refuted his analysis, but his books were still more popular than those by Simon as an economist. Why? Because the demand for Ehrlich’s book is the same as for horror fictions instead of correct economic analysis. Ehrlich kept writing books full of mistakes, not to provide correct economic analysis, but to attract readers as an alarmist. There are similar cases in China too. Who should carry the blames, economics, or some so-called economists?\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that when people enjoy themselves by reading horror fictions, they know that they are just fictions, it will not feel panic. Who would believe that the film of “2012” would become real, and be so horrified to sell out their properties or even commit suicide? But when some economists, with the name of a scientist, are engaged in faking horror fictions, the consequences will be severe. The public thought what they provide were correct economic analysis, but they only make alarmist remarks to earn money. If the government does believe them and implement economic policies according to the analysis of such economists, the consequence will be disastrous.\n\n\n1.

Many readers may believe that those individuals major in economics are easier to find good jobs (and jobs with high incomes), or learn to know how to earn money. In reality, those whose careers are economic-related do have higher incomes, but they are not the richest ones while the richest ones may not be those major in economics or even have never learned economics.\nAs an economics teacher, I hope that the readers would master the way of thinking like an economist as most are not, and will not be economists. They do not need to be economists, but they need to think like economists. \nAs mentioned above, economics is a science, analyzing problems objectively just like natural science. However, natural science only teaches us how to analyze problems about the matter, while economics teaches us how to analyze the problems about human. To learn to think like an economist is to learn to analyze problems objectively, ruling out emotions like anger, as this should be economics most benefit to ordinary people.\nBesides, some economists distort economics analysis for their interests and try to mislead the public and governments to benefit themselves. Therefore, if one has learned economics, he will not be fooled by such economists. Mrs. Robinson, a famous British female economist, once said: “I study economics in order to avoid being deceived by economists.” That is also my Motto.\n"},"Lecture03/":{"url":"Lecture03/","title":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 3: Self-interest: the Postulate of Economics\nIn the last lecture, we have clarified that economics is a science. Science starts from one or some postulates and axioms, and through logical deduction constructs a theoretical system that can explain facts. Therefore, in this chapter, we are going to introduce the postulate of economics.\n"},"Lecture03/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Self-interest\nThe postulate of economics is \"Self-interest\" or more grandly \"Rationality\".\nThe postulate of Self-interest means that human will try to achieve the best result with the lowest cost. It can be regarded as a biological instinct of animals. Under different circumstances, \"the least cost\" can be equivalent to the lowest price of money spent or the minimal resources consumed, while \"best results\" can be equivalent to the maximal income or revenue.\nCaution: self-interest does not mean to benefit oneself by harming others unless harming others is the least costly way to realize one's self-interest goal. In fact, in most cases, in order to benefit oneself with the least cost, one can better act altruistically. As mentioned in Lecture 1, there is a famous example in the book, Wealth of Nation written by the founder of economics, Adam Smith. It says: the baker bakes bread for his good. He wants to earn money from buyers, but as a result, it also meets their needs. So, subjectively he is doing the job for his good, but objectively he is providing us with food, which benefits himself and others at the same time. He could rob people to get money, but that would put himself in jail. Also, he could beg for money, but few people would be willing to give beggar money for nothing, which means begging would not earn him as much as selling bread. After comparing the costs of the different ways of getting money, he chooses the one with the lowest cost and the highest income, which generally is selling bread. \nOf course, if the place where baker lives had poor public security, robbery would become easier, because the risk of being caught would not be high enough. When committing crime costs less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. Thus, the choice between obeying the law and committing a crime is also the result of selfish-interest by measuring incomes and costs. Actually, beggars are said to have a higher income than bakers; however, not too much people are willing to be beggars, because bakers are more respectable, which means that the so-called income should not narrowly be considered as monetary income, but also contains reputation, dignity, and other non-monetary income. So, incomes include monetary ones and non-monetary. The same applies to costs. If one does not choose to be a beggar, the total incomes of beggar must be not higher than those of baker, and the total costs are not lower, which implies that self-interest dominates his behavior.\nLet us think about this phenomenon more profound. Why do bakers earn more non-monetary incomes than beggars? Due to morality, bakers are respected while beggars are belittled. However, why is morality as such? Because bakers contribute to others and create new wealth by providing bread, while beggars do not contribute to others and create no wealth for society. They transfer wealth from those who donate. In other words, morality guides human to realize self-interest by altruism. That is precisely the reason why human need morality. Morality rewards self-interest acts by altruism, belittles those without benefits to others (such as begging) and condemns those by harming others (such as robbing). Therefore, robbery is not only sanctioned by law but also bears the pressure of moral condemnation which is a non-monetary cost. So morality increases the total costs of robbery. This is the same as the market guiding human to behave altruistically by price and the law preventing them from harming others by penalty.\nTraditional morality makes it shameful to be a beggar, but modern social welfare essentially encourages people to be beggars. The original intention of social welfare is to help the poor, but the real effect is to support the lazy. The reason is straightforward: for one who is not sick or disabled, without the belittling of morality as a non-monetary cost, why not just sit there and live on relief. The national debt crisis of Greece tells this truth: the Greeks are not born to be lazy, and it is the long-term social welfare that makes them so. Also, it corrupts morality which praises self-reliance and belittles idleness. People feel no shame in taking it for granted to ask for money from the government, and scold government no matter it refuses or gives less than before. \n"},"Lecture03/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True","keywords":"","body":"﻿# Section 2: The Postulate Needs not to be True\nSomeone may argue, “I am not self-interested. It is wrong that economics postulates that one is self-interested.” However, the postulates and axioms of science do not need any proof, which means they do not need to be real or genuine. However, they do need to be tested by facts. It means the theories deduced from them can explain phenomena in reality. If they can’t, the postulates and axioms must be modified or even rejected. Therefore, what can reject the postulate of self-interest is the explanation power of theories deducted from it instead of the truth or correctness of it.\nSome experimental economists try to prove that the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong. However, they make an elementary logical mistake. In Lecture 2 about the methodology of science, it has been pointed out that if “A ⇒ B” is tested, then \"not (B) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. One cannot conclude that “A ⇒ B” is wrong because “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”. Thus it is also seriously wrong to refute economics by experiments which refute the postulate of self-interest or rationality.\nLet us consider this imaginary example to show that even if the postulate of self-interest or rationality is wrong, it can still explain or predict correctly.1There are a group of people who are going to build gas stations, and there are three places available: the highway, the mountain and the desert. Suppose the construction costs are the same in these three places. According to the postulate of self-interest or rationality, economics predicts that they will build gas stations along the highway. Actually they are idiots, so it is totally wrong to postulate them to be self-interested or rational. Nevertheless, it does not matter! These idiots build gas stations just at random, so some of them build the gas stations in the mountain, while some of them in the desert. Of course, some idiots happen to build the gas stations along the highway. After some time, gas stations in the mountain and dessert go bankrupt because income earned cannot cover operational costs while those along the highway are prosperous and survive more in the business. The final result is the same as economic prediction. That is enough! It is not important whether they choose the place to build the gas stations by careful calculation or at random. It is essential that finally there is no gas station in the mountain or the desert, but there are along the highway, so facts have not refuted the economic prediction.\nMilton Friedman (1912-2006) gave another similar example in his book “Price Theory”. Why do plants grow toward the sun? Biology has a theory to explain this phenomenon. The growth of leaves needs sunlight for photosynthesis, so more leaves are growing in the direction toward the sun and vice versa. As time passes, plants appear to grow toward the sun. Economics can also explain this phenomenon. How? Plants are postulated to be self-interested or rational, and the sunlight is beneficial to their growth, so they grow towards the sun. It is wrong to postulate plants to be self-interested or rational. How can plants think? It does not matter. The conclusion of economic explanation can be the same as that of biological explanation.\nThere is a new inter-discipline called bio-economics which uses the postulate of economics to deduce the theories explaining the biological phenomena. Moreover, the biological study also supports the postulate of economics. There is a famous book “The Extended Selfish Gene” in biology. It is well-known that species evolve through genetic mutations. Some mutations conform to the nature of selfishness, while some do not. Those genes without the nature of selfishness will be eliminated in natural selection, while those who are selfish survive. The survivors keep duplicating their genes and multiply, which makes selfishness continuously strengthened and inherited, thus ultimately determines that all species, including human, are selfish. Isn’t this process similar to the example of building gas stations by the idiots? Genetic mutations are random, just like the choices of the idiots. Nevertheless, natural selection determines that only the gas stations or genes conforming to the nature of selfishness can survive. It is well-known that Darwin’s idea is natural selection or survival of the fittest, but few know that the exposition inspired him about the self-interest of human in Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”.\nHowever, it is not crucial whether a human is self-interested or not, or whether he is selfish due to the genes as “The Extended Selfish Gene” suggests, because self-interest is a postulate which does not need to be proved but must be accepted. If one does not accept it, then it is better not to study economics. Of course, one can invent a subject with the postulate of un-self-interest. Those who study this subject must accept it, but the theories deducted from it need to be tested by facts. If facts do not refute the theories, one will succeed in establishing a brand-new subject called Economics of Un-self-interest, while the economics now may be renamed as Economics of Self-interest. However, if facts refute one's theories, he has to modify or even abandon the postulate of un-self-interest. No one has been able to do so, because the theories deducted from the postulate of un-self-interest are easily refuted by facts and cannot be established as a subject.\nIn geometry, however, it did happen that new subjects were established by changing postulates. The geometry learned in middle school is “Euclidean geometry” because ancient Greek Euclid established it. There are five postulates in Euclidean geometry. Among them, the axiom derived from the fifth postulate is called “the parallel axiom” that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one”. However, in the 19th century, a Russian adopted a contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, at least two new lines can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” As a result, a new set of geometry theories without logical contradiction within it was deduced based on this new axiom. Later on, another German also deduced another set of new geometry theories without logical contradiction within it based on another contradictory axiom that “in a plane, through any point not on a given line, no new line can be drawn that is parallel to the original one.” Eventually, the geometry based on the parallel axiom is called Euclidean geometry, while those based on alternative axioms other than the parallel one are collectively called non-Euclidean geometries.\nScience is like this: In the first stage, there are one or several postulates which need not be proved, nor need it be true or real, but all in this discipline must accept and abide by the postulates. Anyone can establish new subjects based on different postulates, but whether they are successfully established must be tested by facts.\n\n\n1. This imaginary example is adapted from “The Science of Demand”, the 1st volume of the 1st edition of “Economic Explanation” by Steven N. S. Cheung, The Arcadia Press, May 2001, P44. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed\nSince economics has postulated human to be self-interested, it can not postulate human to be un-self-interested at the same time. In other words, one can not explain human behaviours with un-self-interest, or there can not be cases of un-self-interest. It is the same as Geometry: there can not be any theories that are contradictory to the parallel axiom in Euclidean Geometry. It is also the same as laws. The constitution is the fundamental law of a nation just like postulates and axioms of science. There can not be any laws that are contradictory to the constitution, or else they must be amended or even abolished.\nWhat would happen if economics postulated human to be both self-interested and un-self-interested at the same time? If it was the case, then economics could be able to explain any phenomena, but actually, economics had not been able to explain it all.\nFor instance, why does one cheat others for money: It is because he is self-interested. Moreover, why does one donate money to others? Because he is un-self-interested.\nEconomics seems to have explained both the behaviors, but neither has been explained. When would on earth one be self-interested, and when would he be un-self-interested? How to predict if one would cheat or donate money in advance? As mentioned before, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, theories are more needed to help to predict the future. If human were postulated to be both self-interested and un-self-interested, it would be impossible to predict their behaviors and be impossible to explain when they will cheat or donate money. This scenario brings out the specific case of tautology.\nHowever, it would also be false to answer like that: why does one cheat others of money? Is it because he is self-interested, or why does one donate money to others? Is it because he is un-self-interested?\nSelf-interest is a postulate which can not apply directly to explain phenomena; otherwise, the explanations with it are directly postulated. It would happen again that any phenomena could be explained, but actually, they had not been explained at all, which is also the case of tautology. This scenario shows how it is easy to make the mistakes of tautology!\nIt is relatively easy to explain why one chooses to cheat. As mentioned before, when committing a crime was costing less than selling bread, the baker would change his career path. The explanations for both phenomena are similar. If cheating is an easy way of getting money, and would not be caught by the police, one would tend to do so.\nHow about donating? If the donatee is a rich kid and he can go to school even without donations, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the donatee is a poor kid and he cannot go to school without donations, one would tend to donate to him.\nFurthermore, if the poor kid has no intention of study and donations would not make him study well, one would not tend to donate to him. In contrast, if the kid has the passion and intelligence to study and just lack of money, one would tend to donate to him.\nStill, furthermore, suppose there is a charity and one needs to go a few miles to donate, one would tend to do so. In contrast, if one has to drive or take a car to the backwaters thousands of miles away to donate directly, he would not take such trouble. If there is a severe charity scandal exposed, one finds out that his donations have been abused instead of helping the poor, he would not tend to donate again.1\nThe effect of a charity scandal on donations can be used to demonstrate the methodology of science introduced in the previous lecture. Suppose there are three kinds of economics: Economics of Self-interest, Economics of Un-self-interest, and Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. A charity scandal will be used to test which of them is scientifically valid.\nAccording to the postulate of Economics of Self-interest, if there are scandals, then donations to charity will decline, but if they increase, then Economics of Self-interest is refuted. This situation can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. Donations do drop dramatically after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is scientifically true.\nIn contrast, according to the postulate of Economics of Un-self-interest, donations to the charity will increase due to scandals, but if they decline, Economics of Un-self-interest is refuted. It can present the refutable condition, so it is scientific. However, the donations drop after the exposure of the charity scandal, so it is a scientific fault. It is too easy to refute Economics of Un-self-interest by facts; no wonder no one has ever tried to establish such economics.\nHow about Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest? Can it represent the refutable condition? No way! If the donations to the charity decline, it will say because human is self-interested now; while if they increase, it will say because human is un-self-interested now. It is always true, no matter what happens. However, precisely due to its irrefutability, it is a tautology instead of a science. One may doubt if there would be such ridiculous economics. Of course, there is, but with higher-sounding names. Earlier there was a concept of \"bounded rationality\" that prevailed for a while, and the idea of \"irrationality\" has been alive until now. Besides, there is \"behavioral economics\" which is rather popular and hot at present. The nature of all above is Economics of Sometimes Self-interest and Sometimes Un-self-interest. There are full of such non-scientific concepts and ideas in mainstream economics; no wonder it is despised by natural scientists.\nIn short, although donating is a kind of philanthropy which seems to be contrary to the postulate of self-interest, in fact, it is dominated by self-interest. Self-interest means that people will try to achieve the best results with the least cost. When one wants to help others, he still wants to achieve the best result for this goal with the least cost. So it is better to donate to poor kids rather than to rich ones. It is better to donate to the hard-working kids other than to those without the intention of studying. Moreover, it costs less to distribute the donations by a reputable charity. However, if the charity is not reliable at all, it is better to send directly to the donatees by oneself. Thus, the fact that human is altruistic has not refuted the postulate of self-interest. Because even if altruism is the result one wants to achieve, he still wants to achieve it with the least cost, which means that self-interest still dominates his behaviors.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain donating, but we can show how self-interest dominates the choices of a donator under different constraints. \"Constraint\" is a fundamental concept in economics, meaning the objective restriction on human's behaviors. Self-interest is also a restriction on human behaviors, but it is a postulate, needs not to be true and not an objective fact, while constraint must be.\nThe postulate of self-interest can not directly apply to explain human behaviors in economics. Instead, we need to point out different constraints and predict what a self-interested person will do under such constraints. This is both a prediction and an explanation. Finally, we need to investigate whether the person does do so as we predict. If he does, that means facts have tested the postulate of self-interest; otherwise, it has been refuted.\nNeither can the postulate of self-interest directly apply to explain robbery or cheating. Different constraints are: one is that the police are powerful, and robbers and cheaters will be caught and punished. Under such a constraint, self-interested people will not choose to commit crimes. The other is the opposite situation, and it is more profitable to commit a crime.\nIn conclusion, there are different choices or behaviors of human not because human are sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because of different constraints. We can not apply economics to explain what has happened or predict what will happen by changing the postulate of self-interest, but investigating the change of constraints. \n\n\n1. Some may argue that there is a trick with the concept of donation in the explanation. Upon donating, the question is why one chooses to donate? Rather than why one chooses to donate to a poor and hard-working kid after he had chosen to donate. Indeed, there are two aspects of questions about donation. Firstly, why does one choose to donate, or why does one not keep the money for his use? Secondly, having chosen to donate, how does one choose to donate with the least costs and best result. The explanation here is the answer to the second question. The first question has been answered when it is discussed why human needs morality in the first section of this lecture. More specifically, suppose there are two persons in a society, and one is poor while the other is rich. If there were no morality, the rich one would only think about himself, while the poor one would die of starvation. Then only the rich will survive, but the question is how long he could survive in competition with other animals after he is alone in the society? However, if there is morality, the rich would donate his surplus to the poor one who would not die of starvation, and thus the competition with other animals will be minimal, and a chance for survival will be higher in comparison to if he was left alone.This example shows that morality is precisely the result of selfish-interest of all human beings as a whole who tries to maximize the chances of survival in competitions with other species. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture03/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: Rationality is not Equivalent to Correctness\nIn Mainstream Economics or textbooks, there are often mistakes of being a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, because there are so many theories about \"irrationality\". For instance, it is said that there is irrational exuberance when the stock market is rising too much. As mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, the meaning of self-interest and rationality is the same. If one is said to be irrational, it means he is un-self-interested, which is a conflict with the postulate of economics, so it is a serious mistake. Some economists would be cautious about saying that it is difficult to judge how much the stock index could be regarded as irrationality. However, it is not the problem of how to judge if the stock index is irrational or not. It is forbidden in economics to use irrationality to explain human behaviors, which is the same as it is forbidden in non-Euclidean geometry to use the parallel axiom.\nNo matter how crazily the price of a stock rises, it is rational. That sounds too ridiculous to accept. Nevertheless, the critical point is: that human is self-interested or rational does not mean they are sure to make correct choices. The crazily rising of a stock price is the result of the investors' rational choices which may not be correct. Are rational or self-interested choices correct? Regardless of the cases mentioned before that committing crimes is rational but morally wrong behavior, here is another case. One is rational to make a choice, which means he believes he can achieve the best result with the lowest cost, but he may find he is wrong in the end. In other words, he has not achieved the best result or paid a higher price.\nTake the stock investment as an example. One must believe the price of the stock he is going to buy would rise. However, the price of the stock may fall after he bought, so he suffered a loss. Was he irrational? No, he only made a mistake in his expectation of the stock price.\nMoreover, why did he make a mistake? Because he is not the omniscient God! He thought that the stock price would rise, but it falls eventually. If he could know the price would fall in advance, of course, he would not choose to buy the stock. It is not because he is irrational, but because he does not know! If he knew the price would fall in advance, but he still chose to buy the stock, then the postulate of rationality would have been refuted by facts. That has never happened.\nHuman is rational, but he is not omniscient, which means ignorance is a constraint. Some have reliable inside information of the stock market, and know more than others or are less constrained, so their choices are more correct than those who are relatively ignorant. They are not more rational than others, but just under a different constraint. It is always the difference of constraints rather than rationality or irrationality that causes different human behaviors and their results.\nLet us consider another example in reality for illustration. A student of economics posted in an economic forum that a classmate of his had not been going to take the postgraduate entrance examination. However, later he heard that someone not as good as he had passed the examination, so he completely changed his decision. The poster felt doubt that his classmate changed his decision just due to hearing such a piece of news. Is it right for economics to postulate human to be rational?\nHas it refuted the postulate of rationality? Of course not. The classmate was not going to take the postgraduate entrance examination, of which he must have estimated the cost and benefit. He had to choose to spend time preparing for the exam or job hunting. Once he failed in the exam, neither had a job, he would suffer a significant loss. In the beginning, he estimated the exam to be very difficult. It must be because of the information he had that made him believe that he had little chance to pass. He rationally gave up the exam after the calculation the cost and benefit. Later, he got some new information that someone not as good as he had passed the exam, so he adjusted his estimation about the exam, which means the constraints have changed. Thanks to the new information, he now knows better about the difficulty of the exam or becomes less ignorant than he was before. Along with the change of constraints, his choice or behavior also changed. If he knew that a postgraduate degree was better than a graduate job and he could pass the exam, but he still did not change his choice, then we would have arrived in conclusion that postulate of rationality has been refuted. Remember: it is always the change of constraints other than the postulate of self-interest or rationality that can be used to explain human's behaviors.\nSome economists suggest that the reasons why self-interested or rational people cannot make correct choices are divided into ignorance and uncertainty. However, they are the same because uncertainty means it is impossible to completely know the future, which is equivalent to the ignorance of the future.\nIgnorance is also a constraint which is defined as transaction cost in economics. Transaction cost is a fundamental but complicated concept, so it will not be explained in detail until the later lecture in this book. However, this concept is so indispensable that we need to frequently apply it to almost every issue of economics before that lecture. A reader can take his time to comprehend it by observing how it is applied.\nOne kind of transaction costs is information cost which is the cost of acquiring information. Ignorance is precisely due to information cost. One would choose to be ignorant rationally when there is too high information cost. Ignorance is a rational choice! One can benefit from knowing more, for which he has to pay formation cost. If the information cost is higher than the benefit, it is not worth knowing more, so it is rational to choose to be ignorant. When one becomes more enlightened, he is constrained less by information cost.\nAs mentioned above, uncertainty is the ignorance of the future. Human has made great efforts to predict the future, including weather prediction, earthquake prediction and even such unscientific means as fortune-telling. Great efforts imply tremendous information costs. To sum up, information cost is one kind of transaction costs, and transaction cost is a significant constraint that would affect human's behaviors. \n"},"Lecture03/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture03/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Consequences of Ignoring the Postulate of Self-interest\nEconomics postulates human to be self-interested. It does not matter whether it is true or false. What does matter is facts have not rejected the results deduced from it. If the government does not take this postulate into account, or even just not carefully enough, there would be unexpected effects of policy implementation which would even run counter to the original intentions. For example, social welfare is intended to help the poor and the weak, but it makes them lazy and even corrupts morality. There are such counterproductive policies everywhere in reality. The policy-makers should be cautious: do not just think that the original intentions are good, but try to have a guess what the self-interested people would respond with a countermeasure.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: RATIONAL DRIVERS?1\nAir-bags reduce, on average, the severity of auto injuries and the risk of death from motor accidents. However, given that additional safety margin, it might well be rational for motorists to drive more aggressively!\nIs such an adaptation observed? Steven Peterson, George Hoffer, and Edward Millner examined statistics collected by the state of Virginia about fatal two-car accidents in 1993.   In 30 such accidents, one car was equipped with an air-bag, and the other was not. The accident reports identified in each case the supposed \"initiator\" the party was driving more aggressively. The table indicates that in 22 of the 30 accidents (73%) the initiators drove cars with air-bags, although only 50% of the cars involved in accidents were air-bag equipped. So, the indications are, having an air-bag increased the likelihood of a driver to initiate an accident.\nTwo-car accidents with/without air-bags (Virginia, 1993)\n\n\n\n\nWith air-bags\nWithout air-bags\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cars\n30 (50%)\n30 (50%)\n\n\nNumber of \"initiators\"\n22 (73%)\n8 (27%)\n\n\n\nSource: Adapted from Peterson et >al., p. 262.\nAny single bit of evidence such as this can only be indicative, not conclusive. Moreover, even if entirely valid, these results do not necessarily imply that regulations requiring air-bags are inadvisable. Although drivers of airbag-equipped vehicles may indeed be more inclined to take risks, the increased aggressiveness may not entirely cancel out the overall beneficial safety effect of air-bags.\n\nThis reading material illustrates that air-bags are equipped to reduce the damage of accidents, the intention of which is good. However, the result is out of expectation. Because of the reduction of the damage of a car accident, drivers become aggressive in driving. Under the constraint of the cars equipped with air-bags, the costs of aggressive driving decrease from severe disability or even death to minor injury or disability. As a result, drivers tend to drive faster. The risk of severe damage caused by a car accident is reduced, while that of the happening of car accidents increases. So the number of victims of accidents may increase. The result is uncertain for drivers, but for pedestrians without air-bags on their backs, they are sure to be harmed. Then for the whole society, air-bags equipped in cars may do more harm than good.\nIn order to eliminate crimes, some have suggested a death penalty to be imposed on all crimes regardless of their severities. However, once the severity of the penalty was out of line with that of crime, the costs and benefits faced by a criminal would be distorted, and he would make distorted choices. Just imagine what would happen if a nation did do so. The criminal rate would certainly plunge, and minor offences such as stealing would almost disappear, but serious crimes such as murder would increase. Why? Suppose now one was out of money and with no option but to steal or rob. Meanwhile, the police's detection rate cannot be 100%. In other words, one might not be caught and punished. So what kind of crimes would one opt to commit? Will one opt for petty stealing or robbing a bank? The consequences of being caught in both cases would be the same: death penalty. The same costs with different revenues, what would one choose? The answer is obvious. The legislation should base on objective analysis instead of passion, or else there would be horrible consequences. No nation has implemented such a death penalty, which implies it is unfit to survive.\n\n\n1.

However, we cannot directly use the postulate to explain phenomena, but show how self-interest manipulates people to make different choices under different constraints. There are various kinds of constraints, and in this lecture, we will start with a crucial constraint: scarcity.\n"},"Lecture04/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Scarcity","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Scarcity\nScarcity means that compared to people’s desire, the goods they want are not enough. Scarcity is an essential constraint because if there were no scarcity, people would not have to make any choice even if they are self-interested. Just imagine that everything we want was unlimitedly satisfying. Thus no matter how self- interested we are, we would always get all of them. So why should we bother to make any choice anymore? However, goods are scarce, and we have to give up something in order to get other things else, so self-interest matters much in carefully calculating how to obtain goods at the lowest price.\nIn economics, anything of which available is preferred to non-available is defined as a “good” regardless of whether it is a tangible commodity or intangible service, or spiritual enjoyment (including feelings). Some economics textbooks define a “bad” as anything of which non-available is preferred to available, such as garbage and noise. However, with proper redefinition, all “bads” can be converted to “goods”, such as garbage to “cleaning up garbage”. Thus it is not necessary to analyze “bads,” and only “goods” are enough.\nIf anything of which not only available is preferred to non-available, but also more is preferred to less, it is defined as an “economic good”. That means it is scarce, so anyone who wants to obtain it must pay a cost or a price if it is in the market. If anything of which available is preferred to non-available, but more is not preferred to less, it is a “free good” which means it is not scarce and takes no cost.\nWe have to be cautious of what is called “free” in daily life as it often means no need to pay the price in the market, which is not the same as taking no cost. So what is free in the market may not be a free good. For instance, public space is free to enter, but of which more is preferred to less, and is not a free good.\nSo what is a free good? Let’s take the air as an example. In the place where the air is fresh and clean, of air available is preferred to non-available. Even indispensable, but because it is so abundant that no one will pay a cost for more of it, the air is herein a free good. However, in a big city where the air is often impure, fresh and clean air becomes scarce. People are willing to pay a cost for more fresh and clean air, such as buying air purifiers, paying higher prices for houses with better greening. Air herein becomes an economic good. For underwater workers, the air is so scarce that they will pay a rather high price to buy bottled oxygen. Goods are almost economic goods, while free goods are rare and only exist under certain conditions, which means scarcity is ubiquitous.\nSome may envision a future society with extreme material abundance. Can it be a society without scarcity where the distribution of goods could be according to people’s want? Let alone whether or not a society in the future can genuinely achieve such extreme material abundance that the supply of some goods is unlimited relative to human’s need, even if this could be true, would there be no scarcity?\nIn colleges, there are always empty seats in classrooms, because number of seats is higher than that of students. Since one student can only take one seat at a time, the supply of seats is unlimited relative to their needs. However, is there no scarcity for seats? Why are more front-row seats occupied while back-row ones mostly left empty? The key is the different qualities of seats! The front-row seats are good, while the back-row seats are bad ones. Thus, although the seats outnumber the students in the classroom, the good ones are still less than the students, so they are still scarce! The so-called good and bad emerge from comparison, so no matter how many seats there are in the classroom, there is only one seat that is the best. Otherwise, how can it be called “the best”? Similarly, there is also only one seat that is the second-best, and the same to the third, the fourth…best. There is always scarcity!\nSo this is the key to scarcity: if there is no quality difference among goods, increasing the number of goods can eliminate scarcity. However, the difference in the quality of goods leads to scarcity, even if the quantity of goods far exceeds the want.\nThus, in order to realize the ideal society without scarcity, we need not only extreme material abundance but also eliminate all the quality difference - including the quality difference among human beings. It is a pity that God created human being unfairly. Some persons, e.g. Einstein, are born with higher IQs. Maybe in that ideal society, a person would take an IQ test as he/she is just born, and if his/her IQ were higher than a “standard man,” some surgery would be needed to eliminate the higher part of IQ. Also, those whose physical quality is superior, such as sports stars, would need elimination operations. The question is, who would wish to live in such a “Brave New World”?\nGod created human being both fairly and unfairly. The unfairness has been talked about, while the fairness lies in the fact that no matter how mediocre in many aspects, one can always find a specific aspect superior to others. However, it may not be necessarily useful in the market, so it does not have a price. That is why most people are mediocre. If all the quality differences were to be eliminated, not only Einstein or sports stars would have to undertake the operation, but all of us would do so to eliminate every aspect of quality difference according to a “standard man.”\n"},"Lecture04/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Competition, Competition Criterion, and Game rule","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Competition, Competition Criterion, and Game rule\nHuman is self-interested, and the goods he wants is scarce, so there is naturally fight for the goods. Competition means self-interested people fight for scarce goods. There is always competition, as long as there are self-interest and scarcity.1 The following lectures will talk about the market structure, including free competition and monopoly. However, do not misunderstand that only in the free competition market there is competition while there is not in the monopoly market. There is still competition in the monopoly market, just in another form. So it is totally wrong that economics textbooks or some economists boast about the lack of competition.\nIn any competition, winners must be selected out of players, but how? Competition in sports is the most obvious one that people can experience, so let us take it as an example. For instance, in a running race, there is a standard or criterion of “speed” to select out the winner: the fastest runner wins, and slow ones lose. In order to make sure that the winner will be the fastest runner, there are a bunch of rules in the game. Such as all players should start from the same line and kick-off at the same time, and drugs are prohibited. Just imagine that if jumping the gun were allowed, the first person crossing the finishing line might not be the one who runs fastest. So the rules of the game are designed to establish the criterion of competition.\nLet us generalize the above analysis. Suppose now we go to a grand theatre to enjoy an idol singer’s concert instead of taking a lecture in a college classroom. Surely there are more seats in the grand theatre than in the college classroom, but there are even much more people like to enjoy the concert. It is obvious that there is scarcity, so competition is inevitable. How to decide who wins and who loses? How to decide who can get those seats at the concert? For many, the first part of this question may not be easy to answer, but the latter part is rather easy, so almost everyone can answer without thinking, “Tickets for sale!” Bingo! This is precisely the criterion for deciding wins or loses: Price! Whoever is willing to pay the price of the ticket will get the designated seat, while whoever is unwilling will not get one. The essence of using price to decide the winners of the competition is the distribution of scarce goods by a price, which is commonly known as the market economy! In other words, the market economy is the price criterion for competition.\nHowever, in reality, there are many other criteria other than the price criterion for competition.\nTake the example of seats in college classroom mentioned above. Although the good seats are still scarce, they are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis instead of paying a price. The early birds occupy the better seat, while the later ones have to sit in back-row. Moreover, the seats may also be allocated by a teacher who has the right to decide which students can sit where, which is the case in elementary and secondary schools. The seats may also be allocated by age or longevity, which is precisely the hierarchical system of seniority. This kind of allocation for seats is prevalent at the meetings of government. The seats may also be allocated by voting, where who gets the most votes can take the best seat. This is so-called democracy. \nLast but not least, the seats may also be allocated by force. Although one may arrive first and occupy the best seat, if the latter student is much taller and stronger, and by waving his fist, one may be threatened to give up the best seat to him. This is so-called “the law of the jungle,” which is the law of nature, and rules not only human society but also the whole nature.\nCriteria like these are countless, all of which are named as “non-pricing criteria” in economics because they all do not use price as the competition criterion.\nWhy does economics single out the price criterion and leave all other criteria to another category? Because among all the competition criteria, price criterion is the only one that does not lead to the so-called “waste.” The word “waste” is not entirely correct, so should be revised to the more strict term “rent dissipation” which is rather complicated, so will be explained in later lectures in detail. Whereas “waste” is commonly known and easy to understand, so it is used here to express the meaning of “rent dissipation” for the time being.\nWhy does price criterion not cause waste? Because with price criterion, those who want to obtain the scarce goods must pay a price, i.e. paying money. On the one hand, the money the buyers pay becomes the seller’s income, which means the money does not disappear in vain from the view of the whole society. On the other hand, where does the money paid by buyers come from? It comes from selling something needed by others in the market. That is to say, in order to satisfy his self-interest, one must benefit others first, to get money to take part in the competition. The more one contributes to others or the society, the more money he gets, and the higher the chance of winning the competition with price criterion. In the last lecture, it is mentioned that self-interest does not necessarily mean harming others, and, in many cases, altruism is the best way to self-interest. The market is precisely a system that guides the self-interested human to benefit others. From the above analysis, we can further understand how the market economy decides winners or losers by price criterion and guides the self-interested human to benefit others first in order to win in a competition.\nSomeone might doubt: if it is the price criterion that decides winners or losers, wouldn’t the rich always win? Firstly, with this competition criterion, the rich are indeed in a more favorable position, and that is exactly why people are motivated to seek more income by benefiting others and creating more wealth for society.\nSecondly, even with the price criterion, the rich are just more capable of paying a high price than the poor. It means that they are less limited by the constraint of wealth, but not necessarily more willing to do so. Take the above pop star concert as an example. Let us assume the singer is an idol of the young who are willing to pay hundreds of RMB to buy tickets of the concert, while others are not attracted. The older persons who have worked for years are generally richer than most of the young, but will usually not pay, although they can afford the price. So, in the competition for tickets, the young though poor win, the old though rich lose. If the price of a ticket were low enough, such as a few dozens or even tens of RMB, the old might also be willing to pay. Nevertheless, when the price is too high - higher than what they think to be worth, they will not buy. Similarly, few people will buy high-grade fruit for dozens or even hundreds of RMB. Can’t they afford it? Impossible! Even the young who have not worked can afford hundreds of RMB to buy concert tickets for their idol. How come the old cannot afford the high-grade fruit? It is not that they cannot afford, but that they do not think it is worth the price, so will not buy.\nSomeone might also doubt: may the money people use to bid for goods necessarily come from their previous contributions to society? Maybe they get the money by stealing, robbing or cheating. First of all, in the last lecture, it has been analyzed in details that as long as there are effective laws to punish the crime of robbing, stealing, and cheating, a self-interested human will choose to get money by contributing to society, instead of by harming others. Morality will also condemn such harmful behaviors to increase the non-monetary costs. Secondly, as mentioned above, the criterion to decide winners or losers needs a bunch of game rules to establish it. These laws and morality are exactly the game rules that establish the price criterion!\nIf a person competes for scarce goods with the money by robbing, is it different from those who win a running race by jumping the gun or doping sneakily? Without the laws that effectively punish those who get money by harming others, a self-interested human will choose to harm instead of benefiting others. It is just as that if the game rules of running race do not forbid jumping the gun, self-interested runners will choose to try to train the technique of jumping the gun instead of reacting quickly to it.\nFurthermore, if robbing is legal, the muggers can not only rob the money for bidding goods but also the goods themselves without paying any price at all. In this extreme circumstance, the price criterion for deciding winners or losers has fallen apart entirely.\nIn the later lectures, we will explain the legal system to establish the price criterion (i.e. the market economy). It is the system of protecting private property rights or PPRs - the law forbids robbing since it infringes the victim’s PPRs. The PPR is a very complex concept which will be explained in the later lectures. As a short introduction: PPRs include use right, the right to income, and the right to transfer. The legal system of protecting PPRs is the cornerstone of the market economy. It is just empty talk if we only talk about the market economy as a competition criterion without legal system as the game rule.\nIt is said that the market economy should be divided into a good one and bad one. The market economy in developed countries is a good one, while that in the vast majority of developing countries is a bad one although most of them are not socialist countries practicing planned economy. It is implied that in developed countries, the market economy is supported by the rule of law; while in developing countries, there is no rule of law, so they are overwhelmed by bureaucratic corruptions. There are also other different descriptions, such as “crony capitalism”. All of these are a severe misunderstanding about the market economy! Without an effective legal system as the cornerstone, there is impossible to be a market economy, because it is not the price criterion but other non-price criteria such as force and power that decide winners or losers of competitions. How can a running race that allows jumping the gun and doping be recognized as a normal one? So, the market economy is not divided into a good one and bad one, but rather into a true one and fake one!\n\n\n1. Strictly speaking, the condition of “society” must be added, and along with self-interest and scarcity can lead to competition. In a one-man world, no matter how self-interested a person is, he just needs to compete with nature and animals. However, economics as a social science is not concerned with this kind of competition. Economics focus on the competition among humans which only exist in society. The concept of “society” will be defined in the lecture of “transaction costs”. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture04/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture04/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Postulate of Self-interest Must be Followed","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Choice of Competition Criteria\nAs mentioned above, there is no so-called waste with price criterion to decide winners or losers of competition. However, other non-price criteria will undoubtedly result in waste more or less. For example, first-come-first-served will cause queuing. One stands in line with nothing else to do, and he has paid the cost of time - a kind of opportunity cost that will be explained in the later lecture about costs. While no one gets any benefit from his waiting, so he contributes nothing to society. That is why it is a waste. In contrast, if he pays the price directly, the seller will get the money which comes from the buyer’s previous contributions to society.\nIf it is up to the teacher to decide who gets the best seats, students will try to flatter the teacher, such as licking the shoes or even giving packets of money, which is equivalent to paying the price to the teacher. However, this kind of bribery is prohibited by law. The process of law enforcement (including reporting, filing, taking evidence, trial, and judgment, etc.) involves huge costs and is wasteful. If law enforcement is not strict, teachers will be careless in teaching but obsessed with how to collect packets of money from students skillfully.\nIf it is seniority that determines who can get good seats, obviously self-interested human will choose to do nothing but wait for getting older, which cause a waste similar to waiting in line. In state-owned enterprises where seniority prevails, there are significantly more “old dogs”, which is precisely one of the main reasons for the inefficiency there.\nIf the allocation of seats is decided by democratic voting, people will form pressure groups to lobby for votes. In the later lecture of “Political Economics,” we will explain why it is wasteful, and show that voting on specific issues will result in an infringement of PPRs.\nIf it is the law of the jungle that prevails, a human will keep strong and spend money on weapons. It is good to be strong, but if it is for harming others, instead of producing or creating more wealth, it is again a waste. Not to mention the weapons are made for massacre.\nIn conclusion, all non-price criteria of competition are bound to be more or less wasteful, which should be called “rent dissipation” in economic. Rent dissipation is a kind of transaction cost which will be talked about in details in the later lectures of “Transaction Cost” and “Rent Dissipation”.\nAs a smart reader, one might point out: since human is self-interested, and price criterion does not cause rent dissipation, while the non-price criterion surely does, self-interested human should only choose price criterion and never choose any non-price criteria. But this conclusion is obviously not consistent with the fact (i.e., rejected by the fact). The answer is: although price criterion does not cause so-called waste, the market transaction will cause transaction costs, which shall be explained in the later lecture of “Transaction Cost”. Also, in order to establish price criterion, there must be an effective legal system to protect PPRs as the game rule whose establishment and operation will also cost a lot, and it is also a kind of transaction cost. Again, the detailed explanation will be in the lecture of “Transaction Cost”, and here is only the brief main point. The cost of price criterion or market transaction is the transaction cost in a narrow sense, while the cost of the legal system is that in a broad sense.\nTherefore, if price is chosen as competition criterion, there will be transaction cost, while if a non-price criterion is chosen, there will be rent dissipation which is also a kind of transaction cost. So, which will be chosen: price criterion or non-price one? The answer depends on the constraints in a specific circumstance. Under different constraints, the transaction costs involved in price criterion and non-price criterion will vary. Of course, self-interested human will choose the one that causes the least transaction cost.\nThus, the postulate of self-interest dominates all economic theories, and along with different constraints, determines all explanations of human behaviors.\nThe name “economics” is in fact somewhat misleading. A layperson would think that economics can only explain the human behaviors in the economic field. However, it is far beyond that field. The behavior of human choice, in the economic or other fields, can be explained by economics. This book has taken numerous examples to illustrate economic explanation which are not limited in the economic field but also involves other fields such as law, political science, history, sociology, and anthropology. From this perspective, the more accurate name for this discipline should be “Science of Human Behaviors”. Some call this as “economics imperialism” which means “invasion” into other fields of discipline by using the logic of economics. More appropriately, economics is the whole of social science, instead of just a part of it. Because social science is the study of human beings, and no social sciences other than economics has found suitable postulates, and base on them to construct a theoretical framework which is logically self-consistent and stand up facts test (i.e., “refutable”). Therefore, only based on the postulate of economics can other social sciences be regarded as “science”, which means they are part of economics, just the applications of economics in different fields.\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the last lecture, there is an interdisciplinary “biological economics” nowadays, which extends the postulate of economics to natural sciences. By assuming non-human organisms (such as plants, or even genes) are self-interested, it explains some biological phenomena. Thus, in the broadest sense, economics is the science that can explain all of the following phenomena: by assuming the subjects (human or non-human) are self-interested, regard all phenomena of the subjects as their choice with purpose under certain constraints.\n"},"Lecture05/":{"url":"Lecture05/","title":"Lecture 5: Positive Economics and Normative Economics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 5: Positive Economics and Normative Economics\nThe previous lectures expound that economics is a social science, like physics and other natural sciences, which logically derive a theoretical system based on some postulates and axioms to explain various phenomena in reality. However, as mentioned in Lecture 2, the subject of economics is human, while that of physics is nonliving matter. So economics is severely affected by an economist who himself is also human, and the incompetent or ill-intentioned ones of them often distort the research deliberately or unconsciously and let their personal feelings or even interests interfere with scientific study.\nHow can economists avoid distorting economic analysis with personal feelings or interests? Moreover, how can the ordinary learn to think like economists even when they do not need to become economist, and free from the delusion by the economists’ intentional or unintentional misanalysis? Answer: we should distinguish clearly between positive economics and normative economics.\n"},"Lecture05/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section01.html","title":"Section1: Positive economics","keywords":"","body":"Section1: Positive economics\nPositive economics or “empirical analysis” argues that economic theories are used to explain the phenomena, and answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. Based on the postulate of self-interest, along with the constraints changes, economics explains various kinds of human behaviors. Economics is not responsible for answering such questions as “Is self-interest good?”, “Should human be self-interested?” or “should a person make such a choice?”\nAs mentioned in Lecture 2, if there is a one-hundred-dollar bill on the ground, it will be blown away by the wind if there is so, which is a phenomenon that can be explained by physics. However, the bill will still disappear in the absence of wind, which is a phenomenon that physics cannot explain, but economics can. The economic explanation for it is: because human is self-interested, if there is no watching over or surveillance camera, which is the constraint, it is sure that someone will take away the bill. Economics is only responsible for answering why someone will take the bill away, but not answering whether he should take it away. Physics is also only responsible for answering why the bill will disappear when there is wind, but not answering whether the wind should blow it away. However, because physics deals with nonliving matter such as wind, physicists are hardly criticized for not answering the latter question. Whereas because economics deals with human behavior, economists are often criticized harshly for not answering such question as to whether particular human behavior is good or bad, which is even blamed bitterly as immoral!\nImagine that someone threw garbage out of a high-rise building and injured a passer-by. Newton came to answer why the garbage fell to the ground instead of flying up to the sky after leaving human’s hand. Smith came to answer why the man threw the garbage out of the building instead of putting it in a trash can. A moralist came to answer whether the man should throw the garbage out of the building.\nAn economist does not talk about morality, which does not mean he is immoral. As an economist, when he analyzes human behaviors with economic theories, he only needs to answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. It is morality that is responsible for answering the latter question. It is just the division for different disciplines. Asking an economist to answer whether particular human behavior is good or bad is like asking Newton whether an apple should fall to the ground. To criticize an economist coming to a conclusion you do not like is as ridiculous as to blame an apple which fell from a tree and injured a passer-by, “Damn it! What a bad apple! How can it fell exactly when someone is passing by?”\n"},"Lecture05/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Normative economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Normative economics\nHowever, government always asks economists questions of “ought to be”, such as how should government solve an economic problem, or whether a policy is good or bad and whether it should implement or not……So how should economists do?\nTo answer these questions, economists should answer the question of “to be”, that is, analyze empirically at first. Take the case of car airbag in Lecture 3 for example. Government might ask economists: “Should be a policy of stipulating all cars to have airbags implemented?” Economists should conduct objective scientific analysis with economics at first, pointing out that because of the self-interested nature of human, with airbags on cars, drivers will drive more recklessly, which lead to more car accidents and casualties. Then economists do not need to say anything more, and government would naturally know how to do. If what government wants are fewer car accidents and casualties, given the economists’ analysis, it is clear that a mandatory stipulation of car airbags can not hit the target.\nOf course, it is also possible that government has colluded with airbag manufacturers, so what it wants is to force everyone to buy airbags. Obviously it is improper for the airbag manufacturers to openly claim that they push government to implement a policy for their interest, so they come up with a seemingly plausible and grandiose reason. Government explains that airbags can help to reduce casualties when a car accident happens, so they are good for drivers. If the objective and neutral economists present the correct economic analysis mentioned above, the self-interested airbag manufacturers will often deliberately incite the resentments of the public, cause confusions in the argument, and attack the economists for not caring about drivers’ life as immoral. The ignorant public cannot objectively analyze the truth, so are easy to cheat. Some of them are drivers, and they wrongly believe that the agents of airbag manufacturers care more about their benefits than the neutral and so-called “immoral” economists. Airbag manufacturers will surely try to hide their real purpose from the public, so they let their agents, including some other economists who appear to have no interest with them, to speak in public. Finally government implements the stipulation about airbags, ostensibly accepting the advice of some economists who are agents of airbag manufacturers while turning his back to the objective and neutral analysis. Some ignorant enjoy the pleasure of scolding the so-called “immoral” economists. Moreover, the drivers have to spend more money on car airbags, not knowing that they may bear a higher risk of car accident casualties!\nSuch cases happen again and again in reality: government asks for advice from economists about policy, but he may not be for the public’s interest. Some economists are either disabled or not objectively neutral. The public can not positively analyze the effect of the policy, so they do not know the truth and enjoy the pleasure of scolding others. The victims are harmed in ignorance, and at the same time, pay for the costs in silence.\nThe society is full of such self-interested persons who have complicated interests and speak with deceptions. One of the purposes of studying economics is precisely to learn to analyze objectively. Positive economics teaches us not to ask the questions of “ought to be”, but only or at least firstly ask the questions of “to be”. Please do not believe what the self-interested persons say, but observe what they do. It is not essential what the good intentions of the government’s policies are, while what the measurable effects they have mattered because the final effects often run counter with the original intentions.\nTherefore, normative economics, or “normative analysis”, must be based on the empirical or positive analysis. Only after the empirical analysis is conducted can we take value judgment into account. Take the example of airbags: what does government want? If he does want to reduce car accidents, it is not necessary to make a policy about airbags. It would be the opposite case for policy-making if what he wants is to benefit airbag manufacturers. A value judgment is not science but ethics, and government often has its idea, so economists should not put a finger in, or else they will just be used for the unspoken purpose.\n"},"Lecture05/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section03.html","title":"Section3: Value Judgment","keywords":"","body":"Section3: Value Judgment\nAs mentioned at the end of the previous lecture, non-price criteria would lead to rent dissipation which is a kind of transaction costs. Although there is not rent dissipation for price criterion, there is transaction cost (in a narrow sense) for using the market. What is more, in order for price criterion to be established, there must be a legal system protecting PPRs as the game rule, and there is also transaction cost (in a broad sense) for the establishment, operation and maintenance of the legal system. Therefore, whether people choose price criterion or non-price criteria depends on their transaction costs under different constraints. Self-interested people will, of course, choose the criterion with less transaction cost.\nIn fact, in such cases as to how to allocate seats in a classroom, people will seldom choose price criterion (e.g. auction). However, it is neither decided by democratic voting or by force, but the non-price criterion of first-come-first-served. Why? Because the benefit of the best seat is minor. In order to distribute such a minor benefit, it is not worth taking the trouble to organize an auction or voting, or fight with each other, which means there is transaction cost and it outweighs the benefit. Although there is rent dissipation (a kind of transaction costs) for first-come-first-served as a non-price criterion, it is still the least costly way among all for the allocation of seats in a classroom and chosen by self-interested people.\nIn reality, there are both market (price criterion) and non-market (non-price criteria) behaviors, but the latter is often ignored in MSE. There is a big issue related to this ignorance: is the market economy better or planned economy better? There was once a heated ideological debate in China, and today it seems that a conclusion has been reached that the market economy is good. Really?\nWhat is the meaning of “good”? If one likes an apple, he will think apples are good. While if one likes pears, he will think pears are good. Here good and bad are subjective value judgments, and there is no objective standard, so it is a question that science cannot answer. However, if an objective criterion (for example, the more the nutrition, the better) is set in advance, and it is also necessary to precisely determine what kind of nutrition it is, who will eat the fruit, and whether he lacks that kind of nutrition, which are all constraints, then science can answer the question “Which is better for someone, apple or pear?” Strictly speaking, science answers the question “which is more nutritious for someone, apple or pear”, and further answers the question “should someone eat apple or pear?”\nTurn to economics. Is the market economy better or planned economy better? If there is no objective standard set in advance, it can only be judged by subjective value, and economics as a science cannot answer. However, if “the less the cost is, the better” is the objective standard, the question becomes: “is the cost of a market economy or a planned economy less?” Market economy and planned economy are different economic institutions. As will be analyzed in the later lecture on “transaction costs”, the cost of an institution is the transaction costs in a broad sense. Therefore, this question is actually about the transaction costs of the market economy and planned economy. However, it can be seen from the above example of allocating the seats in a classroom that it is not enough when there is only objective standard because specific constraints are also needed. Without constraints, it is impossible to identify the transaction costs of different competition criteria.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, normative economics must be based on empirical analysis, along with objective standard which should be set in advance. Firstly in empirical analysis, different choices are analyzed under specific constraints. Then according to the objective standard set in advance, economics as science can answer the questions of “ought to be.”\n"},"Lecture05/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture05/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Problems of Welfare Economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Problems of Welfare Economics\nIn economics, the normative analysis is concentrated in a branch called “welfare economics”. Do not misunderstand that it is the study of the welfare economy; instead, it tries to use “waste” or “inefficiency” as an objective criterion to answer the question of “to be”.\nWelfare economics will be discussed in the later lecture of “The Coase Theorem”, and herein we just give a brief. There cannot be “waste” or “inefficiency” in economics, which is a direct conflict with the postulate of self-interest. In Lecture 3, it has been emphasized that there cannot be any theory or explanation conflict with the postulate of self-interest. In that lecture, it has also been pointed out that the so-called “irrationality” is wrong in that information costs (a kind of transaction costs) are ignored, so human is rational to choose to be ignorant. The so-called “waste” or “inefficiency” in welfare economics is also wrong in neglecting transaction costs.\nIn Lecture 1, it has been cautious that there are many mistakes in MSE. They stem from two primary sources, one of which is the omission of critical constraints, and transaction costs are precisely the constraints that are often overlooked. The theories neglecting transaction costs will be a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, and of course they are serious mistakes, just as the laws that are conflict with the Constitution are serious mistakes. If a law is unconstitutional, it must be amended to conform to the Constitution, or even repealed. According to the same logic, welfare economics, which takes “waste” or “inefficiency” as the criterion of value judgment and is a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, should be abandoned.\n"},"Lecture06/":{"url":"Lecture06/","title":"Lecture 6: The History of Economic Thinking -- Microeconomics and Macroeconomics","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 6: The History of Economic Thinking -- Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\nEconomics is divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics, which copies the division of physics.

Newtonian mechanics belong to macro-physics which is measured in meter. And micro-physics study molecular and atomic levels of matter where the laws of movements are different from those followed by macroscopic objects.\nUnlike physics, there is microeconomics first, then macro later.

From then on to today, economics has gone through two stages: classical economics and neoclassical economics. Until today, it is still in the neoclassical period. In addition to Smith, the famous classical economists include David Ricardo (1772-1823), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), etc. Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) published “The Principles of Economics” in 1890, which marked the transition from classical economics to neoclassical economics, so he is the second greatest master only next to Smith in economics. His “Principles of Economics” is regarded as the first textbook in economics, and today’s economics textbooks all follow it in the structure. The masterpieces of classical economics such as Smith’s “Wealth of Nations”, Ricardo’s “On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation” and Mill’s “Principles of Political Economics” are obviously different from the current economics textbooks which are quite similar to Marshall’s “Principles of Economics”.\nThere were no terms of micro and macro in classical economics, but there were the concepts of them which were very different from those in neoclassical economics. In classical economics, there are two fields of study: resource allocation and income distribution. The former could be regarded as micro and the latter to be macro.\nClassical economics focuses on analyzing how the market mechanism (price criterion) guides the allocation of resources for production, and how the income from the sales of products is distributed to the owners of the resources. Classical economists advocated the free market and believed that government only needed to play the role of “a night watchman”. There are two duties for a night watchman: one is to tell the time, the other is to patrol for fire prevention and security. In other words, in the view of classical economists, the role of government was minimal, and it should not interfere in the market. The spontaneous working of the market was enough to arrange all kinds of economic activities in a society correctly.\nEven transmitting to neoclassical economics, economists were still of this opinion about the free market, and only introduced mathematics (mainly geometry) to present and deduce economic theories. Economists had long believed in the market.\n"},"Lecture06/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Rise and Decline of Keynesian Economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Rise and Decline of Keynesian Economics\nHowever, the Great Depression (GD) triggered by the stock crash in the United States from 1929 to 1933 which swept through the significant economies shook the public’s trust in economists, thus shaking economists’ trust in the market and even the economics itself.\nAccording to the theory of supply and demand that will be introduced later, the market can adjust demand and supply through price changes so that they are always equal. However, it seemed that the orthodox theories in economics could not explain the phenomena of overproduction (i.e. the supply of products exceeds the demand), continuous price decline (deflation, i.e. the demand of money exceeds the supply) and high unemployment rate (i.e. the supply of labor exceeds the demand) during the GD. \nEspecially the “Say’s Law” which believed that “supply would automatically create demand equal to itself” was regarded as an infallible law at that time. From the perspective of it, supply and demand could not be out of balance, let alone for a long time.\nDuring the GD, there was a bitter joke: A son asked his father, “Why don’t we buy coal for warming during this cold winter?” The father replied, “Because I lost my job, we have no money to buy coal.” The son asked again, “Why did you lose your job?” The father replied, “Because the coal company I worked for could not sell out the coals and went bankrupt, we as the employees were all fired.”\nHere is what the history textbooks record: President Roosevelt of the US stood up at this critical moment to implement the “New Deal” and turned the tide by government interventions in the market, saving the US economy, ending the GD, also ending the history of letting the free market spontaneously adjust the national economy, and starting the era of big government.\nSome views of Keynesian economics have been taught in the ideological and political education of middle school in China. It is the story in textbooks: British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) wrote his “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” in which he criticized the orthodox economics that advocated the free market, and then established a set of theories analyzing the national economy and advocating government interventions in the market.\nUnfortunately, these so-called “historical facts” which are vividly described in textbooks are wrong because of severe misunderstanding and misinterpretation. Friedman, the founder of the monetary school, co-authored with Anna Jacobsen Schwartz (1915-2012) “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960”. With a large number of facts, excellent statistical skills and dominant monetary theory, Friedman discovered the truth of this period of history by strict logical economic analysis, completely overturning previous understanding of the causes of the GD.\nRoosevelt’s New Deal was implemented earlier than Keynes’s “The General Theory”. On the contrary, Keynes was inspired to write his book by Roosevelt’s New Deal.\nHowever, it was not Roosevelt’s New Deal that freed the US from the GD, but war! The unemployment rate is a definite proof. At the beginning of the GD, the unemployment rate in the US was as high as 25%, which means one in four was unemployed. Later, the rate was reduced to about 10% due to the automatic adjustment of the market and the public works of the New Deal, but it was still severe unemployment. It was not until after the US went to the World War II that the problem of high unemployment had been really solved because many people joined the army to fight overseas, which significantly reduced the supply of labor, and the increasing demand for the war materials boosted the demand for labor. Only then did the US truly get rid of the GD. It was in 1929 that the stock market crashed, and it was in 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor that the US went to war, while it was since 1933 that Roosevelt’s New Deal had been implemented when he became president, so there are nearly ten years between them. If the New Deal was effective, the problem of high unemployment rate should have been solved.\nBesides Roosevelt tried to get rid of the GD with New Deal, Hitler also led the Germans to another road of self-rescue by starting a war, extricated Germany from the crisis much faster than the US, and even dominated the European continent, of course just temporarily.\nThere is an idiom in China called “quenching thirst with poison”. If it is judged whether it is useful only from whether it can quench thirst (get rid of the GD), poison (Hitler’s militarism) also works, but the final result is death. However, Keynes’s prescription is also a chronic poison, and just because its toxicity cannot be observed immediately, it seemed at the beginning to be effective, just as when Hitler came to power, he seemed to save Germany out of crisis overnight. So Keynesian economics was thought to be the remedy of economic diseases caused by market failure, and was widely used in almost all economies after World War II.\nKeynes was so ambitious that he originally intended to replace the traditional economics since Adam Smith completely. However, some economists made a compromise that traditional economics was also right, except that the scope of application was different from Keynesian economics. The former focuses on how the micro-entities in the market such as individuals and enterprises consume, produce and exchange guided by price. And the latter is concerned about how government closely monitors the national economy, just like a doctor caring for patients, and prescribes according to Keynesian economics to regulate the economy, ensuring that it moves forward on a healthy track. So these economists separate traditional economics from Keynesian economics, arguing that they apply to different fields, just like physics.\nThus, the traditional economics is renamed as “microeconomics”, and Keynesian economics is called “macroeconomics”. By the way, it was Keynes’s father who first introduced the concepts of micro and macro into economics from physics. This compromise of the traditional economics and Keynesian economics is known as “Neoclassical Synthesis” which includes both market mechanisms advocated by neoclassical economics and government regulations or interventions in the market by Keynesian economics. However, Keynes himself did not agree with neoclassical synthesis. Even Keynes and Keynesian School are of different opinions. In Keynesian School, neoclassical factors are added into Keynesian economics. For example, the IS-LM Model is established by this school instead of Keynes.\nHowever, in the 1970s, the sequela of governments taking Keynes’s prescription for long terms finally broke out. If the end of World War II in 1945 is taken as the starting point, it just took less than 30 years. Seen from the angle of long history, it was not a very chronic poisoning. It should be the oil crisis in the 1970s that accelerated the outbreak of the sequela, and a new term “stagflation” spread quickly, which was a phenomenon that Keynesian economics could not explain. In Keynesian economics, inflation and economic stagnation should replace each other, and could occur at the same time.\nThere have been questions on Keynes in economics, which was just not noticed by the public before. The Monetary School led by Friedman came first, followed by the Supply School and the Rational Expectation School. The neoclassical synthesis was also criticized to divide economics into micro and macro with entirely different application scope and irrelevant to each other. Some economists advocate “supplementation of the micro foundation for macro” which means that macroeconomics should be rebuilt based on microeconomics or neoclassical economics. However, it is more thorough that economics should not be divided into micro and macro at all!\n"},"Lecture06/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: Price Theory and Monetary Theory","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: Price Theory and Monetary Theory\nIn some universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the US, the appellations of micro and macro are considered misleading, and the terms of “price theory” and “monetary theory” are respectively used to replace them.\nAs mentioned above, economists of neo-classical synthesis classify traditional economics as microeconomics which focuses on the consumption, production and exchange of the micro-entities (individuals and firms) in the market guided by price. So government intervention is absent in microeconomics, or even if there is a government, it only behaves either like a consumer buying various goods in the market or a producer providing public services to the market. However, in macroeconomics, the role of government is exceptional. It functions as the regulator of the economy (mainly referring to the market), which is entirely different from the role of individuals and firms.\nThose who use the terms “price theory” and “monetary theory” instead of micro and macro are concerned about another difference that they think is essential: money.\nMicroeconomics studies how the price mechanism (price criterion) plays a role in the market and guides different economic entities to make choices. Here the price refers to the relative price in barter where there is no money, or there is money, but the value of money is stable, and the price level is also stable (i.e. there is no inflation or deflation), so the nominal price (monetary price) of a good is the same as its real price (relative price). Thus, there is no monetary effect on the economy, which means “monetary neutrality” advocated by classical economics.\nBy contrast, macroeconomics focuses on money. There is not only money in the economy, but also the value of money may fluctuate, which means the price level is unstable (i.e. there is inflation or deflation). Then the monetary price of a good is different from the real price, so affecting (actually misleading) the economic entities’ choices. And the money in modern nations is all issued by government: most are national governments, few are foreign governments, and Euro is the most special, issued by the European Central Bank, a super-government institution. Therefore, the source of instability of money value directly stems from government which also plays an exceptional role. However it should not interfere in the market and regulate the economy, but should control the money supply to stabilize the value of money and the price level, providing a stable platform for the automatic adjustment of the market. \nObviously, it is monetarists who advocate to replace micro and macro with price theory and monetary theory.\n"},"Lecture06/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Causes of the Great Depression","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Causes of the Great Depression\nIn the previous section, we have introduced briefly the history of economics from the classical period to the neoclassical period and how it “split” into micro and macro. Next, the causes of the Great Depression will be explained to illustrate why Keynesian economics was not the proper remedy to macro-economy, but just a chronic poison.\nIt is well known that the Great Depression began with the crash of the United States stock market in 1929. However, it is not well known that there were stock crashes more severe than that of 1929 both before and after the GD, but they all did not cause such disastrous consequences.\nSome may argue that there were not many investors in the stock market before 1929, so the severe stock crashes occurred in the past did not have so massive impacts as that of 1929. However, after 1929, there are more and more investors in the stock market. Why have more serious stock crashes not brought about as severe consequences as the GD? They may argue that after 1929, governments had Keynes’s prescription to prevent the spread of the stock crashes to macro-economy by intervention with the market. However, during the colonial period in Hong Kong, British-Hong Kong (BHK) government had been implementing the policy of “positive non-intervention” until it was terminated by the last Governor Chris Patten. Hong Kong was the last piece of land on the earth where Smith’s classical thought of “government only needs to play the role of night watchman” was still followed in modern society. During this period, Hong Kong had experienced some stock crashes not less severe than that of the US in 1929. Moreover, the BHK government had never taken any Keynesian prescriptions, but Hong Kong survived unscathed again and again, and the impacts of the stock crashes had never spread to macro-economy of Hong Kong and turned into economic crises.\nWhy? The answer is also the truth of the GD. The truth is: the cause of the stock crash in the US in 1929 was utterly different from that of most stock crashes. The real cause of that stock crash was also the real cause of the economic crisis which the stock crash later turned into. In other words, the stock crash is just the prelude to the GD, not the cause of it. A stock crash alone will not necessarily cause an economic crisis. However, neither will an economic crisis necessarily turn into a great depression. It was a series of mishandling by the US government that turned an ordinary economic crisis that had happened many times before into an unprecedented economic catastrophe - the Great Depression!\nFriedman in his “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960” traced back in detail the data of money supply before and after the stock crash in 1929, eloquently showing that before 1929, the US central bank (the Federal Reserve, or the Fed) injected a large amount of money into the economy. The later lecture of “Monetary Theory” in this book will expound that if the growth of the money supply is out of line with that of the real economy, there will be inflation. However, people (even economists) at that time knew little about monetary theory. That is why the truth or real cause of the GD has been misunderstood for long.\nWhen producers found that the price (nominal price) of goods was rising, they would think that their products were so popular in the market that the demand exceeded the supply. With the stimulus of rising price, they significantly increased production and employed more workers. Because the demand for labor increased, with the limited labor supply, the wage also increased. Workers found that their wages increased, and producers found their profits increased. Everyone found his income increased, and all spent more, so in the short term, the increased supply seemed to be consumed by the increased demand. Investors also spent more money in the stock market, firstly because more income would naturally lead to more savings (the so-called “investment” in the stock market is the same as savings in economics), and secondly because the increase in profits of enterprises made investors full of confidence in the rise of stock prices. As long as there are enough investors who had such confidence, and more chose to buy in stocks instead of selling out, the stock prices would keep rising.\nHowever, everything had an end. It was too much money flowing into the economy that caused “Money Illusion” in the short term, which made people not know that the general rise in prices was inflation, not real economic growth. The illusion is after all only an illusion, not reality. What was praised by the historians as the “roaring 1920s” was just an illusion of prosperity stimulated by inflation in the eyes of the economists. Sooner or later, producers would find that everything was more expensive, not just their products, and their costs also increased, squeezing their profits, so they no longer expanded the productions, but shrank. Consumers also would find that everything was more expensive, not just their incomes, so they cut back on spending. All of a sudden, the wind changed, and the stock market is the most sensitive to the change of economic wind, so the stock price suddenly turned to plummet. Previously, due to the soaring stock prices, a large number of funds that could not bear high risks (such as bank deposits) were attracted into the stock market. The sudden collapse of stock prices wiped out these funds overnight. As a result, several banks went bankrupt, triggering a crisis of confidence in banks. Even the banks that had no problems in trouble were drawn into a run on the banks.\nThese problems in finance quickly spread to the real economy where there was overproduction caused by the illusion of inflation. It is necessary to realize that the overproduction was not the fault of the market at all! It was the central bank (the Fed) that issued too much money, which led to inflation and misled producers into thinking that the rise in product prices was due to the rise in demand, but it was wrong. What had risen was only money supply, so the nominal or monetary price of goods increased, but the real or relative price of goods had not changed at all. Nevertheless, how could producers know that? In a monetary society, what producers could directly observe is the monetary price of their products, and could not know if the central bank had issued too many money, so they would respond to the price rising by expanding productions. If the price as a signal for the demand and supply had been distorted by inflation, the producers’ response would be wrong, because the increased supply had no corresponding increase in demand to consume. That is precisely the real reason why there is a so-called overproduction.\nThe traditional economics (the so-called microeconomics) thinks that the market will pass information about supply and demand to various economic entities by the rise and fall of prices. Prices will rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when demand exceeds supply. All economic entities are self-interested or rational to respond accordingly: when prices rise, producers increase supply and consumers reduce demand; while when prices fall, producers reduce supply and consumers increase demand. These responses are all pushing the changes of supply and demand to be equal. Therefore, it is inconceivable that there will be overproduction for traditional economics. However, the problem lies in the fact that there is money in reality, and the central bank may implement wrong monetary policies due to ignorance or intentionally – before the GD, the Fed were ignorant, but most of the inflations were initiated intentionally. The wrong monetary policy will lead to instability of the money value which appears as the monetary price out of line with the real one. Thus, the information implied by the money prices is not only about supply and demand, but also mixed with the “noise” of inflation, which misleads producers (in fact, including consumers) to respond not to push the changes of supply and demand to be equal, but to be unequal.\nIs this the fault of market or government (central bank)? Who has distorted the price? Who has made the information implied by monetary price mixed with the noise of inflation? Who has misled producers and consumers?\nThere was an even more terrible story to come. The inequality of supply and demand caused the stock crash, which caused a bank crisis. The sharp contraction of the money supply caused by the bank crisis will, in turn, worsen the economic crisis, which will be explained in the later lecture of “Monetary Theory”. In a word, according to the monetary theory understood only by later economists, central bank should increase the money supply when the economy was in recession. However, the Fed did not realize that it had made a mistake of injecting too much money into the economy until after the stock crash, and suddenly changed the monetary policy to tighten the money supply, which is precisely the opposite of what they should do in a financial crisis. It was so dramatic, and it should be said to be tragic! In order to correct a mistake made before, a more significant mistake had been made at the wrong time.\nAs a result, the US economy worsened from an economic crisis characterized by overproduction which had happened before, to a great depression characterized by a continuous sharp fall in prices (severe deflation). The price could not even make up for the cost of transporting the products to the market, so producers chose to destroy them all on the spot to reduce the loss. That was the reason why there were the ridiculous phenomena recorded in history textbooks: milk was poured into the river, and chickens were drowned in the water, instead of being sold out.\n"},"Lecture06/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture06/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: More Truths about the Great Depression","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: More Truths about the Great Depression\nThe cause of the Great Depression explained by Friedman’s “A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960” has been expounded in the previous section. However, this terrible story had more tragic developments, because Friedman only explained the phenomena of overproduction and severe deflation, but did not explain why there had been such a high unemployment rate for ten years. The authorities of the US, not just the Fed, had made a series of serious mistakes, which coincidently joint together to cause such an unprecedented GD.\nThe first big blunder was that the US Congress had just approved business income tax which was vehemently opposed by the traditional economists because it was suspected as double taxation. The profits distributed to the corporate owners after the business income tax would be taxed again by the personal income tax. Here we would not discuss if the business income tax was true or false, but point out that it was equivalent to tax increase. Even Keynesian economics would suggest that in an economic recession government should stimulate the growth of the economy with a tax cut. However, the US Congress at that time increased instead of a decreased tax, which of course further aggravated the shutdown of enterprises, thus increasing unemployment.\nThe second big blunder was that the US Congress was so foolish to approve the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 to substantially raise import duties despite strong oppositions from other countries. Different from the US today, it had trade surplus at that time, how stupid it is to embrace protectionism with such “favorable” trade balance! It was easy to guess what would other countries respond. Yes, they retaliated by also raising the tariffs on the exports of US. As a result, the tariff war broke out, and the international trade plummeted to only one-third of the original value within one year. The hard-hit exports naturally could not help the US economy to get rid of the GD as the Tariff Act had expected, but just made it worsen on the contrary.\nThe third big blunder was the biggest one, whose influence was much worse than the mistakes made by the Fed and the US Congress. It was the minimum wage, trade unions and other institutions that hinder the wage reductions, which led to high unemployment for ten years. Even with chaotic monetary policies which caused severe deflation, and domestic and foreign tax increase, there would not be large-scale and long-term unemployment so long as prices (wages) in the labor market could be flexibly adjusted downward.\nFirstly, the minimum wage, trade unions and other similar institutions nullify the essential role of the (labor) market in equalizing the supply and the demand by adjusting the prices (wages).  In the economic recession, the productions shrink, so the demand for labor decreases. The market is supposed to equalize the supply and the demand by adjusting the price downward. However, if the equilibrium wage which can equalize the supply and the demand in labor market to eliminate unemployment is lower than that stipulated by minimum wage, the market’s adjustment function will, of course, fail to work. If the supply of products exceeds the demand, they cannot be sold; if the supply of labor exceeds the demand, they cannot be sold either, which is precisely unemployment. Is it the market’s fault, or the government’s? Who forbids the market’s adjustment function to work? Who causes the labor market to be disequilibrium with oversupply? Who forces those who may be willing to sell their labor at a price lower than the minimum wage to become unemployed without any income?\nSecondly, the profits of enterprises do be reduced by the price fall in the product market (deflation) and tax increase, which have pushed many enterprises to the edge of a shutdown. However, if the labor cost can be reduced along with the profits reduce, the burden of the enterprises can always be lightened to some extent, thus saving some of them to survive. The survival of enterprises is the most reliable guarantee for the employment of labor.\nReviewing the truth of the GD, one can only sigh and conclude that how wronged traditional economics (and economists) are! However, the most seriously wronged is the market! The market has done nothing wrong. It is human who distorts the price signals with wrong monetary policies. It is also human who with minimum wage law, trade unions and other similar institutions nullify the market’s adjustment function of equalizing the supply and the demand. However, again it is human (such as Keynes) who blame the failure on the market, claiming that if the market is allowed to operate freely, it will cause insufficient aggregate demand, overproduction, high unemployment etc. So the government needs to be like a hero in an economic crisis, standing up to correct market’s errors. It is similar to that someone buys a machine and does not follow the instructions of the manual to mishandle it, causing such a severe problem that others are hurt or even killed, but he blames the machine for having design defects!\nWell, the market is not a person, so it can not stand up to defend itself against human’s slander and false accusation. It does not matter, because it is the economic rule that is the final judger. One can wrong the market, but he cannot escape the punishment of economic rule, just as one is sure to fall from the sky and lose his life if he does not follow Newton’s laws. As the history of Keynesian economics mentioned in section 2, only 30 years later, the punishment of economic rule had come.\nUntil nowadays, there have been such punishments in various countries around the world. The specific plots of tragedies may be different, but there is no fundamental difference in essence. The latest ones are the financial turmoil in the US in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe in 2009.\nHuman should keep his eyes open to see the truth clearly: it is human, not the market, who has been torturing himself!\n"},"Lecture07/":{"url":"Lecture07/","title":"Lecture 7: Equilibrium•Optimum•Margin","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 7: Equilibrium•Optimum•Margin\n"},"Lecture07/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Equilibrium and Optimum","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Equilibrium and Optimum\nAs mentioned in the previous lecture, economics has copied many concepts from physics. One case is the division of micro and macro, while here is another case of the concept of “Equilibrium” which is very important in economics.\nEquilibrium in physics means that an object is in the state of static or uniform linear motion due to the force balance. For example, the mobile phone on the table is static. Why? Because it is now subject to two forces, one is gravity, and the other is the force of the table supporting it. The two forces are of the same magnitude, but of the opposite directions, so reach a balance, and the mobile phone is in a static state.\nEconomics has copied the concept of equilibrium from physics which refers to a state of static (there cannot be the so-called state of uniform linear motion) when the economic forces are of the same magnitude and the opposite directions. For example, the theory of supply and demand analyzes the two most conventional economic forces in the market: the buyer’s demand for commodities and the seller’s supply of them. These two forces work in opposite directions: buyer’s demand pushes the price to rise, while the seller’s supply pushes it to fall. When they are of the same magnitude, the price will stabilize and remain stationary.\nHowever, economists later find that there are cases when there cannot be at least two economic forces to reach a balance. After all, this concept is copied from physics, and, inevitably, there will often be cases that are incompatible with it. Therefore, economists have revised equilibrium to refer to the state that under certain constraints, each economic entity will no longer adjust his behavior (i.e. remain stationary). Why do economic entities no longer adjust their behaviors? It must be because, under such constraints, they have reached the most favorable positions for themselves, so they are satisfied with staying there, not changing any more. If they have not reached the most favorable positions, the postulate of self-interest implies that they will continue to adjust their behaviors. Equilibrium used in consumer theory, the theory of firm and game theory is such meaning instead of the “force balance” directly copied from physics.\nIn economics, the concept of “optimum” is also often used to describe the above state that individuals adjust their behaviors according to the constraints to make themselves in the most favorable positions. Optimum and equilibrium are related to each other because equilibrium is the overall result when all economic entities have chosen the optimal behaviors. In other words, it is optimum from the perspective of an individual, while it is equilibrium from the perspective of all as a whole. \nHowever, equilibrium in economics is problematic, since this concept in physics is a fact, while it is not in economics. Look out of the window. Cars are running roughly the road or parking on the side, and which one is in the state of equilibrium in physics? The answer is obvious: the parked cars and the running ones in uniform linear motion which can be measured with appropriate tools.  However, look out of the window, is the world in the state of equilibrium in economics? No matter the answer is yes or no, what is the reason? Equilibrium in physics is a fact which is observable or at least measurable with tools, while equilibrium in economics is not a fact because it is neither observable nor measurable.\nAnother criticism that can give a fatal blow to this concept is that since equilibrium refers to the state when individuals all reach the optimum under certain constraints, how can there be disequilibrium? Disequilibrium should mean that individuals do not reach the optimum under certain constraints, which is a conflict with the postulate of self-interest. How can a self-interested person not reach the optimum?\nSome may argue if the constraints change suddenly, the individuals who were in the original state of equilibrium will not have time to adjust their behaviors, so they are in the state of disequilibrium before they adjust their behaviors to reach the new equilibrium. However, it only means that there is transaction cost to adjust the behavior (including the information cost needed to realize that the constraints of the original equilibrium have changed), which is also one kind of constraints. It is wrong to think that individuals are in disequilibrium before they adjust their behaviors to reach the new equilibrium in that the constraint of transaction cost is neglected. In lecture 5, it has been warned that there are many mistakes in mainstream economics, one of which is precisely the neglect of the transaction cost as a constraint. Once the constraint of transaction cost is neglected, there will be mistakes conflict with the postulate of self-interest. The problematic concept of “disequilibrium” once again proves this warning.\nIn short, if all the constraints are taken into account, there is impossible to be disequilibrium in economics. Then what is the sense of equilibrium? Some economists, such as Coase and Steven. N. S. Cheung, have suggested altogether abolishing this concept. However, equilibrium has been used too long and too widely in economics, and intertwined with other economic theories and deeply rooted, so the cost of completely abolishing it is too high. I suggest retaining this concept, but all disequilibrium analysis must be swept out of economics because they are conflict with the postulate of self-interest. Thus the answer to the question whether the world is in the state of equilibrium is: always yes! Anyone who answers no is equivalent to claiming that he does not accept the postulate of self-interest.\nWith transaction cost, some seeming disequilibrium cases are equilibrium ones, which is quite similar to the cases with friction in physics. Imagine a heavy object is pushed by force, but stay still or in equilibrium. Why is that so? It is because the object is also subjected to a friction force in the opposite direction to the push, and of the same magnitude to it, so they offset each other, and the object remains stationary. However, as long as the push to the object is large enough, it will eventually be a move against the friction.\nSimilarly, according to the TSD in economics, if the supply or the demand has changed, the original equilibrium price should fluctuate. However, in reality, price will not change every minute with the always-changing supply and demand. Is the price in the state of disequilibrium? Have facts refuted the TSD? There are cases where the price changes every minute with the always-changing supply and demand in the stock market. It is the transaction cost of adjusting the price every minute that prevents a self-interested human from doing so unless the increase in income from adjusting the price is higher than the transaction cost. The stock prices fluctuate every minute because the stock market is precisely the place with the lowest transaction cost for price adjustment, where a complicated computer system is used to match the supply and demand automatically. \nIf the TSD can only be used to explain the stock price changes, how narrow its application is! In order to avoid falsification of the TSD, it needs to be supplemented with the constraint of transaction cost in price adjustment. With this constraint, a theory with much stronger explanatory power can be deduced, giving new impetus to the traditional TDS: the higher the transaction cost of adjusting price, the lower the frequency of price fluctuations, vice versa.\nFor example, vegetables are sold both in farmers markets and supermarkets. The prices of the vegetables in farmers markets are more flexible than in supermarkets because the transaction cost for price adjustment of the former is lower than that of the latter. The farmers are the owners of the vegetables they sold and have the complete right to set the prices. By contrast, salesmen in the supermarkets are not vegetable owners and have to report to their managers to obtain permissions if the prices need to be adjusted. It is evident that the internal decision-making process of a supermarket is much more time-consuming, so it is possible that when the day is over and the vegetables have been rotted away, the decision about price adjustment has not been made. The much more time-consuming decision-making process implies the much higher transaction cost in supermarkets than in farmers markets, which is the reason why the prices of the vegetables in the latter fluctuate more frequently than in the former.\nThus, the world is always in a state of equilibrium. The so-called disequilibrium phenomenon which seems to refute the TSD is merely due to the neglect of the transaction cost in adjusting prices. It is not a tautology; otherwise, it is also tautology that friction is used to explain why a heavy object may not be pushed to move in physics. More importantly, the above example of vegetable sales demonstrates how to identify different transaction cost by observing different phenomena. Based on these observable facts, instead of an unobservable concept like equilibrium, we can explain why the vegetables in farmers markets and supermarkets have different frequencies of price fluctuation, which rejected the statement that the vegetables in supermarkets with lower frequencies of price fluctuation are in a state of disequilibrium.\nTherefore, economics only needs Static Analysis (the analysis of a particular equilibrium) and Comparative Static Analysis (the analysis of comparing two different equilibriums) which is the analysis of the difference in the constraints of the equilibriums. What is more, economics needs neither disequilibrium analysis nor Dynamic Analysis (the analysis of the process of changing from one equilibrium to another, and it is disequilibrium in the process), because they are wrong in neglecting transaction cost.\nBesides, there is another reason why I suggest retaining the concept of “equilibrium”. There cannot be disequilibrium analysis, but disequilibrium can be used as a tool to help to check if a theory or explanation is right. \nFor example, the conclusions of any economic theories must not be a conflict with the postulate of self-interest, which means they must be in the state of equilibrium. So if the conclusions deduced from a specific theory imply disequilibrium, it must be wrong, the logic of which is equivalent to the reductio in mathematics. It is quite useful to judge whether a theory is wrong, so it is a use of disequilibrium in testing theories.\nFurthermore, if there is disequilibrium in the explanation of a phenomenon, some constraints (often transaction cost) must have been neglected. As far as theories are concerned, economics is not as difficult as natural science like physics, chemistry and biology. However, the difficulty of economics lies in the applications, and mainly lies in investigating the constraints. There may be thousands of constraints relevant to a phenomenon, so it is not easy to screen out the key constraints, which means that information cost is an important constraint in the study of economics. Here disequilibrium helps to find out whether some key constraints are missing. However, it cannot directly tell what the specific constraints are, which still depends on investigations and perhaps experiences. After all, it is still a handy tool to detect omission in an explanation. \nIn brief, disequilibrium can be used as a tool to check if the conclusions of a theory are conflict with the postulate of self-interest and if there are omissions of constraints in an explanation.\n"},"Lecture07/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Concept of Margin","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Concept of Margin\nWhat will be introduced next is the analysis tool for finding an optimum which is the essential analysis tool in economics: marginal analysis.\nIn Lecture 3, the postulate of self-interest has been explained in detail, which refers to that human will try to achieve the best result with the least cost. It is the same meaning of optimum.\nAs mentioned in Lecture 6 about the history of economic thinking, an essential development in the process from classical economics to neoclassical economics is the introduction of mathematics as a deductive tool. Then how to interpret the postulate of self-interest in terms of mathematics?  The answer is the method of finding extrema: the least cost is finding minimum value, while the best result is finding maximum value. Furthermore, how to find extrema in mathematics? In geometry, it is to find where the slope of a curve is zero, or the tangent of a curve at that point is horizontal. While in algebra, it is to find when the derivative is zero.\nA new and important concept of margin is born by the introduction of this mathematical thought (not only the calculation) into economics. From the 1870s to the beginning of the 20th century, the British economist William Stanley Jevons, the French economist Léon Walras of Lausanne School and Carl Menger of the Austrian School independently put forward “margin”, which is called \"marginal revolution\" in the history of economic thinking. From then on, there is marginal analysis everywhere in economics.\nWhat is “margin”? Since this concept initially came from mathematics, the following expounding will start from the perspective of mathematics, and then extend to the economic implication which is not entirely the same as mathematics.\nReaders should be very familiar with two kinds of magnitudes: total magnitude and average magnitude. For example, the total weight of all people in a room is a total magnitude, while the average weight or the weight per capita is calculated by dividing the total weight by the number of people. However, the most crucial magnitude in economics is not total and average magnitudes but marginal magnitude. If someone walks in, which increases the number of people, the total weight will rise. The weight of that person is a marginal magnitude. Moreover, if someone walks out, which decrease the number of people, the total weight will fall. The weight of that person is again a marginal magnitude. \nLet us take an economic example. The two geometric diagrams in Fig.7-1 respectively show the relationship between total revenue (R), average revenue (AR) and marginal revenue (MR). The upper diagram pictures the R function, and the lower diagram the associated AR and MR function. Warning: A total magnitude (such as R in the upper panel) should never be plotted on the same diagram as average and marginal magnitudes (such as AR and MR in the lower panel) because the units of measurement are not the same. The vertical axis of the upper diagram of Fig.7-1 is scaled in dollars, whereas the lower diagram is scaled in dollars per unit quantity.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1\n\nIn algebra, the average magnitude is derived from total magnitude such as $AR = \\frac{R}{Q}$, while the corresponding marginal magnitude is $\\frac{ΔR}{ΔQ}$. According to calculus, if the units of R are continuous, and the change of Q (ΔQ) is infinitely small, it can be rewritten as $\\frac{dR}{dQ}$which is a derivative.\nIn geometry, the average curve is also derived from the total curve. The magnitude of any point on an average curve is the slope of a ray from the origin to the corresponding point on the total curve. Take point N in Fig7-1 as an example. The slope of ON is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, which is dividing Y-coordinate of point N by X-coordinate of it. Y-coordinate represents total revenue (R), while X-coordinate represents quantity (Q). So the diagram implies the same as $AR = \\frac{R}{Q}$ in algebra. How about marginal magnitude? According to calculus, the derivative is the same as the slope of a curve in geometry. Therefore, the magnitude of any point on the marginal curve is the slope of the total curve.\nAfter the introduction about the derivation of average and marginal magnitudes from total magnitudes in terms of algebra and geometry, let us turn to the relations among these three magnitudes. There are a series of propositions.\nLet us continue to take the previous example of people’s weight in a room. When a person walks in, his weight as a marginal magnitude is positive, and the total weight of the people in the room will rise. So the first proposition about the relationship between total magnitude and marginal magnitude is: When a total magnitude is rising, the corresponding marginal magnitude is positive. On the contrary, if a person walks out, his weight as a marginal magnitude is negative, and the total weight of the people in the room will fall. So the second proposition about the relationship between total magnitude and marginal magnitude is: When a total magnitude is falling, the corresponding marginal magnitude is negative.\nThen look at the upper diagram Fig7-1, where is the maximum value of the total revenue (curve R)? It is on the “top of the mountain”. What is the slope there? The answer is zero. That is why in the lower diagram in Fig7-1, the corresponding point in the MR curve is on the X-axis, which means the X-coordinate is zero there. This total curve is a parabola going downwards, but if it is a parabola going upwards, the minimum value of it is at the “bottom of the valley”, where the slope is also zero. So extreme value, no matter it is a maximum or a minimum, appears where the slope is zero on the total curve. In other words, when a total magnitude reaches a maximum or a minimum, the corresponding marginal magnitude is zero, which is the third proposition.\nThe previous three propositions are all about the relations between total and marginal magnitudes, and how about average and marginal magnitudes? Suppose a person walks in, but he now needs to be classified as “fat” or “thin”. If he is heavier than the average weight of the people in the room before he walks in, he is fat. On the contrary, if he is lighter than the average weight, he is thin. It is very reasonable. If a “fat” walks in (geometrically the marginal curve lies above the average curve), the average weight will rise. If a “thin” walks in (geometrically the marginal curve lies below the average curve), the average weight will fall. If a person who is neither fat nor thin (i.e. he is as heavy as the average weight) walks in, the average weight will not change.\nTo sum up, when the average magnitude is falling, the marginal magnitude must lie below it, which is the fourth proposition. On the contrary, when the average magnitude is rising, the marginal magnitude must lie above it, which is the fifth proposition. Finally, when an average magnitude is neither rising nor falling (at a minimum or maximum), the marginal magnitude equals the average magnitude, which is the sixth proposition.\nGeometrically, the marginal curve passes through the highest or lowest point of the average curve. Fig.7-2 shows the relations among these three magnitudes taking total cost, average cost and marginal cost as the example. Let us focus on the lower diagram of average and marginal cost curves which are both parabolas going upwards. To the left of point L, the MC (marginal cost) curve lies below the AC (average cost) curve, which means MC＜AC, so AC is pulled down by MC. To the right of point L, the MC curve lies above the AC curve, which means MC＞AC, so AC is pulled upward by MC. The AC curve is falling to the left of L and rising to the right of L, so L is a turning point where is the “bottom” or the lowest point of the AC curve, and through which the MC curve passes.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2\n\nReaders can deduce by themselves the reverse case where both the average and marginal curves are parabolas going downwards. In the beginning, the marginal curve lies above the average curve, pulling it upward. Later, the marginal curve lies below the average curve, pulling it downward. The turning point, where the average curve changes from rising to falling, is the “top” or the highest point of the average curve, and through which the marginal curve passes.\n\nMathJax = {\n  tex: {\n    inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]\n  },\n  svg: {\n    fontCache: 'global'\n  }\n};\n\n\n"},"Lecture07/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture07/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Economic Implication of Marginal Analysis","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Economic Implication of Marginal Analysis\nIn the previous section, the concept of margin has been introduced from the perspective of mathematics. However, margin is an economic instead of mathematical concept, or else it should not be called “margin” but “derivative”. Margin is still significantly different from derivative in that there is requirement of “continuously differentiability” for derivative. As the example of the weight of people in a room in the previous section, that a person walks in is an incremental change of a discrete instead of a continuous variable because a person cannot be split into two halves, let alone into infinite numbers of infinitesimal persons. Strictly speaking, a discrete variable can not be taken the derivative. However, that is the requirement of mathematics, not economics which is not so demanding. As long as there is incremental change, no matter it is discrete or continuous, it is a margin.\nAs mentioned in Lecture 3, the postulate of self-interest cannot be directly applied to explain human’s behaviors, but should be along with different constraints. If the constraints do not change, neither will human change his behavior, nor will the postulate of self-interest be meaningful. Economics is applied to predict that human will change his behavior according to both the postulate of self-interest and the change of constraints. By investigating whether human really change his behavior as predicted, economics including the postulate of self-interest is tested.\nSelf-interest is a postulate about the motivation of human’s behaviors, and is unobservable intention. However, the change of constraints and human’s behaviors are both observable facts. The postulate of self-interest and the change of constrains constitute the economic explanations which are tested by the change of human’s behaviors. Therefore, if there is no change, there will be neither explanations nor tests. And change is margin! Difference is the same as change, which is also margin: that the same person changes his behaviors along with the change of constraints is logically similar to that different persons have different behaviors under different constraints. \nReview the concept of margin from the perspective of mathematics introduced in previous section: MR or MC is the change of total revenue or cost due to the rise of Q. Similarly, from the perspective of economics, the change of human’s behaviors is due to the change of constraints. This is the economic implication of marginal analysis, which can include all kinds of human’s behaviors and constraints, and that is why marginal analysis is so important in economics.\nNext, we will introduce various applications of marginal analysis in detail.\nFirstly, the basic application of marginal analysis is to explain phenomena or behaviors by using the postulate of self-interest without falling into the trap of tautology.\nFor example, there is a question as homework I designed: a girl claims that she often offers her seat to others on the bus, so she is not self-interested or rational. One of the replies is, “The benefit of psychological comfort from offering her seat on the bus outweighs the loss from the tiredness of standing, so she chooses to offer her seat. By contrast, those who do not offer their seats think the benefit of psychological comfort is too little for them to outweigh the loss of standing.” Is the reply right? How should you refute the girl?\nThe answer to this question is: the reply seems reasonable, but in fact it directly uses the postulate of self-interest to explain the girl’s behavior, which is a tautology. In order to avoid making the mistake of tautology, the change of constraint must be added, which means marginal analysis must be applied. But how? The girl says that she offers her seat “often” instead of “always”. Why does she sometimes offer her seat but sometimes not? Is she sometimes self-interested or rational and sometimes not? It is obviously ridiculous. This is the best refute to the girl.\nOf course, it is not the purpose of economics to refute the girl, but to explain her behavior scientifically. Sometimes she offers her seat and sometimes not, not because she is sometimes self-interested and sometimes not, but because the constraints she faces at different times are different, which leads to different behaviors. The girl will offer her seat on the short-distance bus, but how about on the long-distance train? Once she has offered her seat, she will have to stand for hours or even a whole day. Will she still choose to offer her seat? The girl will offer her seat to the old, children and pregnant women, but how about those who are strong and young? Will she still choose to offer her seat to them?\nThe above cases are not chosen randomly, but purposefully. The former case is about the change in the constraint of increasing cost, while the latter case is about the change in the constraint of decreasing income (the non-monetary income of psychological comfort). It is clear that with the change of constraints, the girl’s behaviors have also changed, and the direction of the change is in line with the postulate self-interest, which means when the cost of offering her seat increases or the income decreases, she tends not to do so. Thus, her own behaviors have definitely refuted her claim that she is not self-interested or rational.\nIn a word, it is the basic application of marginal analysis: to add the change of constraint to the postulate, concepts or theories with the nature of tautology, so that the explanations using them become refutable and scientific.\nSecondly, there are three extended application of marginal analysis.\n(1) Marginal analysis can be used to screen the key constraints.\nThere are thousands of constraints in reality, but it is impossible for all of them to have critical impacts on the phenomena or behaviors to be explained. One of the important applications of marginal analysis is to help to screen the false constraints that seem to have impacts.\nSpecifically, observe whether there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or whether there is the same behavior under different constraints. If the constraint remains unchanged, neither should the relevant behavior change. On the contrary, the behavior will change along with the change of constraint. Therefore, if there are different behaviors under the same constraint, or if there is the same behavior under different constraints, that the relevant constraints may be redundant and not the key ones.\nFor example, since 2012, China has implemented the policy of free passage of cars with less than seven seats on expressways during the National Day. As a result, there has been serious traffic jam on expressways during the National Day. Different parties have explained this phenomenon differently. Economics is a science, and should avoid the disturbance of subjective feelings and interests to judge these explanations from an objective perspective. It is precisely where marginal analysis is very useful.\nSome argue that the traffic jam on expressways is not due to the policy of free passage, but because there are always more cars using expressways during the National Day holiday than usual. In other words, in this explanation, the National Day holiday is regarded as the key constraint which causes traffic jam. However, there was the National Day holiday not only since 2012, which means this constraint has not changed at all. How can it cause the change in the phenomenon that traffic jam was significantly more serious than that in previous years? Thus, it has refuted this explanation of the National Day holiday as the key constraint.\nSome others argue that it may be because the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day in 2012 were linked together, resulting in more traffic than previous years. In this explanation, the long holidays are still regarded as the key constraint, but just the 8-day long holiday of 2012 is longer than before (7 days). However, with marginal analysis, this explanation is again easily refuted. If traffic jam was really caused by the longest holiday in history, this constraint is exactly the same for expressway and national highway. According to marginal analysis, if the constraint is the same, the phenomenon or behavior should be the same, which here means there should the same traffic jams on national highways as on expressways. However, there was not such news of serious traffic jams in national highways.\n(2) In economics, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation, so marginal analysis is more useful.\nDifferent from natural science, it is almost impossible to obtain the total magnitude of a social phenomenon in social science. Fortunately, with marginal analysis, it is marginal magnitude instead of total magnitude that is important for explanation.\nLet us continue to take the free policy on expressways during the National Day since 2010 as an example. According to marginal analysis, we can infer that the free policy is more likely to cause those who originally planned to go out to change from using national highways to expressways than to cause those who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. When one changes from not going out to going out, the increase in marginal cost will not only include the toll of expressways, but also the expense on oil, food, housing and so on. However, if one has already planned to go out, the increase in marginal cost is only the difference of toll between national highways and expressways, which is actually negative with the free policy. Therefore, the free policy will cause all who have planned to go out to change from using national highways to using expressways, but just cause some who originally did not plan to go out to change to going out. We do not need to investigate how much precisely the total cost of going out is, but just need to logically identify the change in marginal cost.\n(3) Equal marginal principle is a useful application of marginal analysis.\nEqual marginal principle which will be discussed in the later lecture of “Market Structure: Price-Searching” is a very useful application of marginal analysis. It can be proved by mathematics that in order to achieve optimum, all relevant factors should be equal on the margin. For example, for producers, in order to achieve so-called profit maximization (strictly speaking, rent maximization), he should try to equalize the marginal revenue and marginal cost of the production (i.e. MR=MC), which is also called production equilibrium.\nIt is a more technical application of marginal analysis, and is widely used in mathematical models. However, even without mathematics, it can be also applied in economics. It can be inferred from equal marginal principle that it is optimal if this principle is satisfied, while it is not optimal if this principle is not satisfied.\nLet us continue to take the free policy on expressways as an example. This free policy seems to be beneficial to people. However, the cost of expressways will not disappear, so the question of how to collect enough money to cover the cost remains. If there is toll for passage of expressways, the cost is covered by those who use expressways. By contrast, if it is free to use expressways, governments need to input fiscal money to cover the cost through tax collection. In the former case, those who use expressways pay the cost, so it is clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal. By contrast, in the latter case, those who use expressways do not pay, but all tax-payers, no matter whether they have used expressways or not, pay the cost by paying taxes. It is not clear how much the marginal cost and marginal revenue are and if they are equal, because the users and payers are not the same people.\nIt is normally thought that the former case is fair while the latter case is unfair. However, economics forbids value judgment. Seen from economics, in the former case, it is easier to achieve the optimum that marginal income is equal to marginal cost, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is lower. By contrast, in the latter case, it is difficult to achieve this optimum, which means the transaction cost satisfying equal marginal principle is higher. Because the users and payers are not the same, the relationship between cost and income is not clear, which causes the so-called “waste” and is harmful to the interest of the whole society by using more social wealth or income to pay higher transaction cost.\nIt is also why there is higher transaction cost for indirect payment than direct payment. It is difficult for a consumer to know whether his consumption has reached the optimum where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, because the cost paid by him is not directly related to the revenue from his consumption. In other words, the information cost (a kind of transaction cost) about the optimal consumption is higher. In particular, consumers misunderstand that there is no cost when there is free policy, but in fact they have paid the cost indirectly by paying taxes, so they will consume too much, which means they consume more than the optimum determined by equal marginal principle, and the part of actual consumption exceeding the optimum is a waste with the cost greater than revenue.\nCaution: even when there is no free policy implemented by government, the market will sometimes voluntarily chooses to use indirect payment, because under some constraint, it is possible that although the transaction cost of indirect payment is relatively higher, there is some other benefit which can cover the transaction cost, and indirect payment is optimal as a whole.\nAs for the example of free policy on expressways, those without cars are often poorer, while those with cars are often richer. It seems extremely unfair to pay the cost of expressways with taxes instead of collecting tolls, because it is equivalent to force the poor who have no cars and do not use expressways but have to pay taxes for expressways to subsidize the rich. However, the key point is those that infringe PPRs are evil policies or laws, no matter whether they infringe the PPRs of the rich or the poor. Therefore, the free policy on expressways is an evil policy not because it “robs” the poor to help the rich, but because it “robs” those who do not use expressways no matter they are poor or rich. No economic theory agrees with “rob the rich to give the poor”.\n"},"Lecture08/":{"url":"Lecture08/","title":"Lecture 8: The Law of Demand","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 8: The Law of Demand\nThe postulate of self-interest has been introduced in Lecture 3. Just like geometry, axiom is derived from postulate. There is only one axiom in economics: the Law of Demand.\n"},"Lecture08/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: The Law of Demand and its Key Points","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: The Law of Demand and its Key Points\nThe law of demand says, “Ceteris paribus (other factors remaining unchanged), less is demanded at a higher price, and vice versa.” In terms of geometry, it is a curve sloping downwards. (See Fig8-1)\n\n  \n\nFigure 8-1\n\nWith respect to the demand curve, there are several key points need to be concerned.\n(1)It is the change in price that causes the change in quantity demanded, not the other way around. In other words, price is an independent variable, while quantity demanded is a dependent variable.  However, as can be seen in fig8-1, price is plotted on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, which is exactly contrary to the common situation in mathematics where independent variable is plotted on x-axis and dependent variables is plotted on the y-axis. Why? There is no special reason, just because Marshall, who invented the demand curve, plotted price on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, which is followed by all economists, thus becomes a convention.\n(2) Price is an observable fact, but strictly speaking, it is not the nominal price or monetary price, but the relative price or real price expressed in other goods. For example, suppose there are two goods: a cell phone and a bottle of water. The cell phone is 1000 RMB and the bottle of water is 1 RMB, which are all monetary prices (nominal prices). The real price of the cell phone should be 1000 bottles of water, and that of one bottle of water is 1/1000 cell phone. As mentioned in Lecture 6, in price theory (or so-called microeconomics) there is only barter without money, so the price of one good is the relative price expressed by another good. Or although there is money, the value of money is stable, so the monetary price is not out of line with the real price. However, if the value of money is unstable, the monetary price will be out of line with the real price. For example, if the monetary price of a cell phone rises to 2000 RMB and that of a bottle of water to 2 RMB, their relative price is still 1000 bottles of water for one cell phone or 1/1000 cell phone for one bottle of water. In other words, the real price has not changed, only the money devalues which means there is inflation. Price theory does not study the influence of money, so the price in it refers to relative prices (real prices).\n(3) Quantity demanded is not an observable fact, but individual's intention, and is different from quantity of purchase which is a fact. Strictly speaking, the law of demand says, “Ceteris paribus, people tend to buy less when price rise, and vice versa. Whether this (psychological) tendency leads to real purchase depends on some specific constraints. Moreover, if quantity demanded is also a fact, the two variables of the demand curve are both facts. Applying the law of demand to explain phenomena is using a fact to explain another fact, which is not allowed by the methodology of science.\n"},"Lecture08/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Ceteris Paribus","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Ceteris Paribus\nThere is “ceteris paribus” at the very beginning of the law of demand. Why? Because there are in fact many factors that affect quantity demanded, not just price. For example, preference and income are also factors that can affect quantity demanded. If one prefers to apple, he will tend to buy apples even at higher price. Or even if the price of apples remains unchanged, with higher income, one will usually tend to buy more apples. However, the law of demand focuses on the relationship between price and quantity demanded, so it is necessary to assume that other factors other than price, which may also cause changes in quantity demanded, remain unchanged, in order to separate the influence of price on quantity demanded. In some economic literatures, the variables studied by the theory or model are called endogenous variables, while the other factors that are not studied but also affect the dependent variables are called exogenous variables.\n “Ceteris paribus” is very important, so it needs to be discussed in detail. Firstly, the law of demand assumes “Ceteris paribus”, which is not like the postulate of selfish-interest which does not need to be proved, not allowed to be questioned, and will never change. Assumption is different from postulate, and is a prerequisite of the application of a theory. If the prerequisite of a theory has not been satisfied, even the prediction of the theory is inconsistent with the fact, it is wrong to claim that the theory is refuted by the fact. It is not the fault of the theory, but of those who wrongly apply the theory.\nFor example, suppose there is a vendor sitting by the street and selling umbrellas for 10 RMB. One day it suddenly rained, and he raised the price to 20 RMB. However, more umbrellas were sold out on that day. Does it refute the law of demand? Of course not, it is the weather as other factor that has changed. There is a series of specific other factors, including the sunny day, behind the demand curve corresponding to the price of 10 RMB. If it is rainy day, this other factor has changed, and the original demand curve of sunny day will no longer apply. Another new demand curve should take the place.\nSuppose that D1 in Fig. 8-2 is the demand curve of umbrella in sunny days and D2 in rainy days. Behind D2 there is a series of specific other factors which are the same as the initial D1 except the “weather” changing from sunny days to rainy days. This new demand curve is obtained by moving the initial one parallel to the right, because at each price level, the quantity demanded corresponding to the D2 is higher than that corresponding to the D1. For example, when the price is P, the quantity demanded corresponding to the D1 is Q1 and that corresponding to the D2 is Q2, which shows that at every price level, due to the influence of rain, the quantity demanded for umbrellas is higher than in sunny days.\n\n  \n\nFigure 8-2\n\nThose who neglect the prerequisite of the law of demand are wrong in directly connecting the point A and point B as a demand curve which slopes upwards. There must be prerequisites for any theory, which is also a part of the theory itself. Take an example in mathematics: when we say 1+1=2, there is an implicit prerequisite of decimal system, but if binary system is actually applied, such as for computers, this calculation is wrong.\nTherefore, the difference between “quantity demanded” and “demand” should be paid attention to. Geometrically, quantity demanded refers to the point on a specific demand curve, so the change in it means the point moving along the same demand curve. And demand refers to the whole demand curve, so the change in demand means the whole curve moving or the point jumping from one demand curve to another.\nMany may think: hey, isn't it obvious? How can anyone make such a stupid mistake? Is it necessary to expound in such detail? However in reality, there are so many economists who make such mistakes, because the changes in other factors are sometimes not so easy as that of changing from sunny days to rainy days in previous example of umbrellas.\nThere was a big debate in economics of China about whether the demand curve could slope upwards which was dubbed as “the demand curve getting its tail up”. Those who advocated that the demand curve could slope upwards are not only ignorant to economics but also to the methodology of science. The law of demand is the axiom of economics, which is the same as the postulate in that it does not need to be proved and must be accepted. If one does not accept the axiom, please get out and establish a new “economics with demand curve sloping upwards”. What’s more, it is not allowed to advocate that the demand curve sometimes slopes downwards and sometimes upwards, because it will make the law of demand become irrefutable tautology which seems to be able to explain everything but in fact explain nothing at all. When the fact is in favor of supporting the demand sloping downwards, it is convenient to say that now the demand curve sloping downwards apply, and vice versa. As a result, it is always true and impossible to be refuted by facts, but just becomes unscientific.\nHowever, those who advocated that the demand curve could slope upwards argued that they had observed phenomena refuting the law of demand law or the demand curve sloping upwards. Really? Let's take three typical examples given by them, and judge by the law of demand.\nThe first example came from a post on an economics forum of a famous university when the debate was hot. The poster said that he saw with his own eyes a clothing store where a skirt was priced 20 RMB but could not be sold out, while later, when the price was increased to 200RMB, it was quickly sold out. Did it refute the law of demand? Of course not. But why? Because some other factors had changed. But what were they? It may not be so obvious in reality.\nThe answer is that other factors here are information costs. The buyer of the skirt certainly did not know that it had been priced 20RMB. If he knew and did not buy when it was priced 20RMB but chose to buy when it was priced 200RMB, his behaviors really refuted the law of demand, which exactly implies that the law of demand is refutable and scientific theory instead of tautology, because it can present the refutable condition. The poster must know that the same skirt had been priced 20RMB before, which meant his information cost was lower, so he would not buy it. He wrongly regarded the buyer’s information cost the same as his, or wrongly regarded the buyer’s demand curve the same as his, so was wrong in directly connecting the point on his demand curve and that on the buyer’s demand curve to form a so-called demand curve sloping upwards.\nThis example needs to be further explained. With information costs which is one kind of transaction costs, consumers are generally not so good at judging the quality of goods in the market as producers, so they adopt the strategy of “judging quality by price” to reduce the relevant information costs. Generally the better the quality is, the higher the price is, which means quality is also a kind of other factors, there are different demand curves for better-quality goods and poorer-quality ones. Thus consumers tend to think that higher-priced goods are of better-quality. However, some sellers will make use of this strategy of “judging quality by price” of consumers to deceive them by deliberately setting a higher price for poor-quality goods. Of course, in the long run, market competition will eliminate this deception, because the information about the good will gradually spread which means the information cost will fall over time. It takes time for consumers to know the truth, which implies there are information costs. For a while, due to the constraint of information cost, some consumers were deceived into thinking that the skirt priced 200RMB was of better-quality than those priced 20RMB.\nThere are two reasons for the demand of the skirt increased after the rise in price. Firstly, the buyer did not know the skirt had been priced 20RMB before, and misjudged the quality of it by the price of 200RMB. Secondly, the demand curve for the skirts of better-quality priced 200RMB is located to the right of that for the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB. In other words, the demand, instead of quantity demanded, for the skirts of better-quality priced 200RMB is greater than that for the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB. As long as one of the above two conditions is not satisfied, the phenomenon seen by the poster will not occur. Take the poster himself for example: he knew the skirt had been priced 20RMB, so he would never misjudge the quality of it. Or if the skirt was priced 20,000RMB, consumers would doubt if a skirt of such top quality would be sold in a small store, so would not be so easily deceived. Even if some consumers were deceived to buy, the demand for the skirts of such “top-quality” would generally be lower than that of the skirts of poorer-quality priced 20RMB.\nNext is the second example which came from an economist: the tuition of MBA (Master of Business Administration) was increasing year by year, but more and more applied for it. Did it refute the law of demand? Again of course not, and again because some other factors had changed which caused the demand curve of MBA to move to the right. It is logically similar to the above example of umbrellas, so Fig. 8-2 can be directly used to explain it.\nWhat other factors had changed in this example? It is not so simple as the example of skirts just now. Only when you have a deeper understanding of the reality can you find out the key. Firstly, MBA was new to many at the very beginning, and few knew it well and did not know whether it was worth its tuition much higher than that of ordinary master degrees in business, so most would just wait and see, and few would try to apply. It is also due to the constraint information costs.  However, people gradually got to know MBA over time, thus increased the demand for it, which meant the fall in information costs had moved the demand curve for MBA to right. Secondly, the network of interpersonal connections is very important in doing business. Relatives, friends, fellows from the same town or province, classmates ... all can shorten the distance between people and are helpful for business. The majority of MBA students are businessmen, so it is certainly a good opportunity for them to form a network of classmates. In other words, MBA is to some extent similar to golfing. The value of education (or sports) in fact is not the most important, while it is much more important that it is a social platform for specific circle of people to form a network. With more and more students applying MBA, the value or the quality of MBA as a social platform was increasing, so its demand curve had moved to right.\nTo sum up, economics is usually not very difficult, but the application is rather difficult because we must have an in-depth and detailed understanding of the reality. Otherwise, only the prerequisite of “ceteris paribus” is enough to confuse many economic students and even economists. That’s because they do not have a good grasp of the law of demand, but also because they do not have enough knowledge of the reality.\n"},"Lecture08/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Explanation of “Buying on the upswing, Selling on the downswing” in the Stock Market","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Explanation of “Buying on the upswing, Selling on the downswing” in the Stock Market\nLast is the third example. There is a jargon called “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” in the stock market, which means investors tend to buy in when the stock price is up, while tend to sell out when the stock price is down. It seems that the more expensive, the more selling, and vice versa. Does it refute the law of demand? Again of course not. But why? Those who choose to buy a stock must expect that the stock price will rise, so the current price is lower than the expected future price, and vice versa. There are even no other factors that have changed in this phenomenon which just directly proves the law of demand.\nWhat really makes an investor decide whether to buy in or sell out is not whether the current price is high or low, but whether the current price is higher or lower than the expected future price. Investors adopt the strategy of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” not because they tend to buy the more expensive stocks and sell the cheaper ones, but the rising price is usually easier to make them expect the price will continue to rise and decide to buy, and vice versa.\nHowever, if the rising price of a stock will only lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise, will it rise endless? It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock. Obviously there are not such things in reality? In reality, the rising price of a stock does not necessarily lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise. When the price rises to a certain level, some will begin to doubt if it has reached the peak, and reverse to sell out to take profits. The higher the price, the more expectations will be reversed. When the number of investors who reverse to sell out exceeds that of those who expect the price will continue to rise, the market will suddenly reverse. It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock.\nThe problem in explaining of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” is that the constraint of rising or falling price of a stock is not enough to determine investors’ behaviors. In other words, with this constraint alone, we cannot reliably predict what investors will behave (decide). The key factor to determine the behaviors in the stock market is actually expectation. However, expectation is a kind of psychological activity, which is like self-interest and quantity demanded as motives and intentions, and cannot be directly used to explain phenomena. Psychological factors or activities are not observable, so cannot be tested by facts, which will make the explanation irrefutable and become tautology.\nThere are two solutions: one is to add observable constraints, which is the solution to deal with self-interest and quantity demanded (as will be explained later, price is the observable constraint); the other is to replace psychological factors with observable constraints, which is precisely the solution to deal with expectation. It is impossible to observe what one expects in his mind, but it is possible to observe the objective factors that form the expectations. For example, the implementation of a policy beneficial to a company will make investors expect the price of the company's stock to rise. In principle, if one can know all the objective factors (constraints) that form investors’ expectations in the stock market, he can accurately predict whether the stock price will rise or fall, how much it will, and when it will. However, it is too difficult, in fact is impossible, to get to know all these constraints, which implies there is serious information cost (transaction cost). What is even more troublesome is that even if the information about the relevant constraints is available, they are changing every minute. Even one can know the relevant constraints for this moment, they may have changed the next minute, so the formation about them soon become useless and new information needs to be collected again.\nThis is the characteristic of the stock market (in fact, all financial markets). There are not only many key constraints, but also they change rapidly which means after they change for once, they will change again in a short time. It is different from the usual decision-making in other fields where there are relatively less key constraints and they are more stable which means after they change for once, they will not change again for a long time. Is the stock market or stock price predictable? The answer is: yes, and no. Yes, because if one can quickly and accurately get to know all the key information, by applying the law of demand, it is enough to predict precisely. No, because in fact no one can get to know all the key information quickly and accurately. There is a school called “technical analysis” based on the charts of stock prices in the past (such as K lines) to guess the future trend. This so-called analysis actually assumes implicitly that “what happened in the past will continue to happen in the future” which has nothing to do with science. From the perspective of science, what happened in the past is based on some specific constraints, and what will happen in the future is based on other specific constraints. Why must these two sets of constraints be the same? No logic or facts can support this assumption. Remind: assumption is different from postulate in that it must be consistent with facts. Due to the too high information costs of getting to know the key constraints, some investors choose to guess based on the constraints in the past, which is understandable (explainable), but there is no reliable scientific basis for such guesses.\nThere are many complicated mathematical models in current finance. However, no matter how complicated the mathematics is, it cannot save the theories with wrong assumption. Mathematics can only ensure that the deduction from the assumption to the conclusion is logically correct, but cannot ensure that the assumption itself is correct. There is an idiom in China that if one go in the wrong direction, the faster he goes, the farther away he will be from his destination.\nStrictly speaking, the financial market is difficult to predict, not because the financial theories are very complicated (as mentioned previously, the law of demand is sufficient), but because it is too difficult to get to know the key constraints. It is irrelevant to overcome this difficulty by applying very complicated mathematics. However, not only economics is helpless for the financial market, but physics is also helpless in some cases because the relevant constraints are too difficult to get to know. The most typical case is that physics cannot predict the outcome of gambling. Take the simplest coin toss as an example. As long as a physicist can accurately and quickly get to know all the relevant constraints such as the force of throwing, gravity, air friction, winds force, etc., he is sure to predict which side of the coin will face up by applying Newton's law. However, because the duration of the coin being thrown up and then falling down is too short, the physicist cannot get to know all the relevant constraints in time. All he can do is to calculate the probability of which side facing up in many tosses (50% for the positive and 50% for the negative), instead of predicting which side facing up at a specific time. In fact, all a financial economist can do is also to calculate the probability of a certain status, but the happening of small probability event can never be ruled out, and it is most horrible or even deadly which is called “black swan event” in the stock market.\nFrom this comparison with physics, it is obvious that the short duration of constraints is the most critical difficulty. The constraints are short-term, which not only means that economists and physicists are unable to get to know all the key constraints in time, but also the information about the constraints quickly expire even if they manage to know. By contrast, insurance, which belongs to finance, also relies on probability, but not influenced by short duration. What’s more, although there are also many complicated constraints in the investments in business, real estate, antique art, etc. other than in the financial market, neither is there the difficult of short duration of constraints. Therefore, economics as a science cannot predict the short-term fluctuations in financial markets, just as physics as a science cannot predict the results of gambling. Anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the stock market is a liar, because it is the same as anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the casino is a liar.\nSome may be still keep asking: if economics cannot predict the financial market, why are there so many securities analysts? And why are there so many people who spend money in enquiring them for forecasts about the stock market? Firstly, those who analyze based on the fundamentals of the companies and public news or inside stories actually investigate the long-term constraints. Of course, the key constraints that will influence the stock price cannot be only long-term ones, so such predictions based on the long-term constraints are helpless for short-term fluctuations. Secondly, as mentioned above, the school of so-called “technical analysis” does not investigate the relevant constraints, but only guess the future according to the past. In addition to the unscientific problem just pointed out, there is also the mistake of “explaining fact with fact” criticized by Marshall. However, this school in the financial market is not the only one who makes money by guessing. Fortune telling is the much older profession of the same nature. There have been always so many people who are willing to pay fortune tellers. What they buy may be just a peace of mind.\nBy the way, Burton Malkiel, a scholar of USA in his popular book “A random walk on Wallstreet” mocked that the return rate of the stock portfolio selected by a monkey with blinders randomly throwing darts would be almost the same as that of the stock portfolio recommended by securities analysts. In order to test this mock, a British magazine “Observe” held a stock-picking competition in 2012 among three teams: one is a cat, one is a group of securities analysts, and the other is a group of middle-school students. The result is that the cat did beat the other two groups of human by totally random selection.\n"},"Lecture08/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Selection of Other Factors –Methodology of Science (2): Occam’s Razor","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Selection of Other Factors –Methodology of Science (2): Occam’s Razor\nThere are more complicated issues to discuss about “other factors.” What on earth are the “other factors?” If “other factors” are any factors other than the price, then the question arises: if any factors other than the price remain unchanged, how can price change? What causes the price to change? So it is actually not simple for “other factors”. Some other factors cannot change, but it is wrong that any factors other than the price cannot change. In other words, other factors should be divided into two categories: changeable and unchangeable ones. Next we will analyze which other factors are unchangeable, and which are as changeable as the price.\nThere are three kinds of other factors. The first kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in demand, and they are unchangeable. As mentioned in the previous examples, weather (which directly affects the demand for umbrellas), information, quality (which directly affects the demand for clothes, MBA, etc.) and income are all unchangeable.\nThe second kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in price, and they must be changeable, because if they do not change, neither will the price change. For example, when it comes to the end of season, the price of off-season clothes will be cut dramatically in clearance sale for funds returning. The qualities of the clothes have not changed, and the buyers also have sufficient information, so they will rush to do shopping. It is precisely the implication of the law of demand! Other factors such as seasonal promotion directly affect the price, so they must be allowed to change.\nThe third kind of other factors is called “intermediate factors”, because they will be caused to change by the change in price, and then their changes will affect the demand. For example, the rise in the price of petrol will, on the one hand, make people buy less petrol (i.e. the demand for petrol drops), but it will also make people buy less cars because one does not need petrol if one does not have a car. Petrol and car are always used together, so the rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to the drop (or rise) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Complements”. The characteristic of complements is that the price of one commodity is inversely related to the demand for the other. The drop in the demand for cars will lead to a drop in the price of cars, which can be explained by the TSD introduced in later lecture and can be understood even with common sense. As car is a supplement to petrol, the drop in the price of cars will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for petrol.\nAnother example: the rise in the price of pork will, on the one hand, make people buy less pork (i.e. the demand for pork will drop), but people still want to eat meat, so they eat chicken instead. Pork and chicken are substitutable in consumption, so a rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to a rise (or drop) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Substitutes”. The characteristic of substitutes is that the price of one commodity is positively related to the demand for the other. The rise in the demand for chicken will lead to a rise in the price of chicken. As chicken is a substitute to pork, the rise in the price of chicken will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for pork.\nAs seen from the above two examples, the change in price of a commodity will lead to the change in demand and price of its supplements and substitutes which will in turn affect the demand of this commodity, so they are the “intermediate factors.” Such intermediate factors must be allowed to change. Why? Because there are not only a large number of intermediate factors, but there are also complex and subtle relationships with the goods analyzed. It is difficult to investigate whether they remain unchanged in reality. Take a real example in marketing. There was once a very successful chocolate advertisement in Britain, which attracted many middle school students. It was thought that only the sales of other candies and snacks would be affected because chocolate is obviously a substitute to them. Unexpectedly, even the sales of games dropped dramatically. After investigation, it was found that the pocket money of middle school students was basically a fixed amount, so when they bought more chocolate, they had to cut their spending on games as well as other candies and snacks. Game makers never thought that chocolate would become their competitor. In other words, any two seemingly unrelated commodities in this world will become substitutes or supplements under certain constraints. Therefore, if intermediate factors are not allowed to change, once one finds that the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts, one can always blame on the change of intermediate factors. However, it is difficult to investigate whether intermediate factors have actually changed, thus the law of demand will easily “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.\nFrom the above explanation on the three kinds of other factors, please pay attention to two key points. Firstly, that the first kind of other factors cannot change does not mean that they can really never change, but that they must remain unchanged on the same demand curve. If such other factors have changed in reality, we must draw another new demand curve. This key point has already been stressed before that “ceteris paribus” is an assumption which is not the same as the postulate of “self-interest”. The postulate will never change and is always regarded as true unconditionally. However, the assumption is a prerequisite for the application of a theory, and it may not be true. It is true only when it is consistent with the facts, and then can the theory be applied.\nSecondly, as mentioned before, there are other factors such as preference, income, etc. that affect the demand besides price. However, “preference” (as well as taste, like, and other similar expressions) should be specifically singled out. It does affect the demand, but one must assume that it will never change not only on the same demand curve, but also on different demand curves! Why? Because preference is a psychological factor, and not an objective fact that is observable.  If it is allowed to change, again one can always blame on the change of preference whenever the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts. The psychological change is not observable by others, thus the law of demand will again “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.\nTake the previous example of umbrella, with the rise of the price, there are still more umbrellas sold out, which is explained by the change of objective fact (other factors) that the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy one. However, it can also be explained by the change of psychological factor that umbrellas are preferred now than before. Although the effect of these two explanations is the same: to draw another new demand curve (both factors directly affect the demand and cause the whole demand curve move), the former explanation can be tested by looking up to see if it is really raining, but how can the latter explanation be tested? Who knows if umbrellas are more preferred now than before. In fact, it is logically similar to that economics forbids using the postulate of sometimes self-interest and sometimes un-self-interest to explain phenomena.\nTo extend the above analysis, the statement that a person’s preference remains unchanged is logically equivalent to the statement that different persons have the same preference. In other words, it is forbidden in economics to use different preferences of different persons to explain their different behaviors. It is said that the Mongolian with much less income than Chinese consume much more than Chinese. It is easy to think that it is because the Mongolian and the Chinese have different consumerism, which is not a scientific explanation. Why the Mongolian has the consumerism different from the Chinese is itself a phenomenon that needs to be explained. In brief, such psychological factors as preference habit, custom, nationality and etc. cannot be used to explain phenomena, but are phenomena to be explained. It is objective facts (constraints) behind these factors that can be used to make a refutable explanation.\nIt is somewhat similar to the previous discussions of expectation and intermediate factor. Intermediate factor is fact, but the change of it is too complicated to investigate, so it is better to let it change. Expectation and preference are the same in that they both belong to psychological factors which are not facts, and they should be replaced by the objective factors (constraints). In other words, the psychological factors are assumed to be unchanged, and it is the objective factors replacing them that change.\nTake the previous example of umbrella again. One explanation is that because the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy day, the whole demand curve for umbrellas moves. Another explanation is that because the umbrellas are preferred more in a rainy day than in a sunny day.  However, preference is a psychological factor. In order to avoid the mistake of tautology, we should further look for objective factors (constraints) that cause this psychology. It is obvious that umbrellas can protect one better from adverse weather in a rainy day (one will get wet in rains without an umbrella, and has a greater chance of getting sick). Rain and illness are objective factors that can be tested by investigating the facts. Thus, the psychological factors that are not facts can be replaced by the logically related objective factors that are facts, and we can avoid the mistake of tautology.\nBoth of the above explanations are refutable and scientific. Obviously, the latter explanation is too long-winded. Here we introduce more requirements for methodology of science: a scientific theory should be not only refutable, but also the simpler the better. In science, there are also competitions among different theories, and there are two competition criteria to decide which one is the winner. The first criterion is “explanatory power” which means the ability to explain as many phenomena as possible without being refuted by facts). It is the theory with the strongest explanatory power that is the winner. If more than one theory can explain the same amount of phenomena, which means their explanatory powers are the same, now it is the second criterion of “simplicity” decide the winner. It is the simpler theory that is the winner. This second criterion in methodology of science is called “Ockham's Razor” because it was proposed by William of Occam (1287–1347), a logician and Franciscan friar from the 13th to 14th centuries. “Occam’s Razor” says “do not multiply entities without necessity”, while the common expression is “the simpler theory, the better.”\nIt is necessary to discuss again the competition between Heliocentric and Geocentric in astronomy. In fact, Copernicus did not intend to reject but to improve Geocentric originally. With the development of astronomical observation technology, more and more phenomena that seem to refute Geocentric are discovered, which means Geocentric cannot explain those phenomena. When a theory is refuted by facts, scientists will not immediately abandon it and start to establish a new one, but try to amend and improve the existing theory. Astronomers at that time (including Copernicus) also did so by constantly adding new contents to Geocentric to explain the newly discovered astronomical phenomena. So Geocentric had not really been refuted at that time, but the problem is that it had become more and more complex which was not consistent with “Occam’s Razor”. If there are no other theories that can explain as many astronomical phenomena as it, astronomers can only endure the increasing complexity of Geocentric and continue to accept it. However, Copernicus observed that, unlike the distance between the earth and other stars would change, the distance between the earth and the sun almost never changes. Logically, there are only two possibilities: either the earth is stationary and the sun revolves around it, which is what Geocentric advocates, or the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it. As the Geocentric became more and more complex, Copernicus changed his thinking: What if the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it? Once this assumption was changed, he found that the explanation of the movements of various stars suddenly became extremely simple -- much simpler than Geocentric! Although all the movements of stars observed at that time could be explained by both Geocentric and Heliocentric, the latter is much simpler, so “Occam’s Razor” cut off Geocentric. In other words, strictly speaking, Geocentric was not refuted by facts in Copernicus era, but replaced by Heliocentric that is simpler with the same (or even stronger) explanatory power. It was not until Galileo's era that the phase of Venus was observed and Geocentric was definitely refuted.\nTherefore, it is not a tautology to use preference to explain phenomena if the objective factors that cause preference is further found, but it is better to directly use those objective factors as explanation.\nThrough the above detailed discussion, it is hoped that the readers have not only learned the specific knowledge about the law of demand, but also further understood the “refutability” and “Occam’s Razor” in methodology of science.\n"},"Lecture08/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture08/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Role of the Law of Demand as An axiom","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Role of the Law of Demand as An axiom\nWhat is the relationship between other factors in the law of demand and the constraints mentioned before? In reality, human’s behavior (choice) is constrained by many factors. Think of Rousseau's words: Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains. If the so-called chains need a clear definition, they are constraints. There is such thing as unconstrained situation, so neither is there is such things as unconstrained freedom.\nFrom the point of view of economics, self-interest is the most important restriction on human’s behavior, but it is a postulate which needs not to be true. Only self-interest is not enough to constrain human’s behavior. It has been pointed out in Lecture 4 that if there were no scarcity, human would not need to choose even if they were self-interested. There are also constraints that restrict human’s behavior along with self-interest. Constraints are objective facts which are essentially different from self-interest. It is the unchanged postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. However, there may be tens of thousands of constraints that cause human’s behavior to change. It is impossible and unnecessary for economics to care about all of them. Only some of constraints need to be singled out to analyze which is called endogenous variables (such as price in the law of demand), while other constraints should be treated as exogenous variables (other factors).\nIt has been repeatedly stressed that it is the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints that are used to explain phenomena in economics, which is precisely the law of demand. The price in the law of demand is a fact, so if widely interpreted, it can be regarded as constraint. Quantity demanded is individual’s intention, so it is a psychological factor, not a fact. There is a negative correlation between price and quantity demanded, or the demand curve slopes downwards, which implies the postulate of self-interest. That is why in economics the demand curve must slope downwards and no exceptions are allowed (no demand curve can slope upwards), because if there were exceptions, it would be inconsistent with the postulate of self-interest.\nThus, the law of demand is not only a theory which can only explain the consumers’ choices in the product market, but also an axiom of economics, and has strong explanatory power. Price can be regarded as constraint, so any constraint that plays a key role in determining the behavior to be explained can be put into the law of demand as price. When there is more than one key constraint, but just one of them is singled out to analyze, the other constraints will be regarded as “other factors” to keep unchanged. In fact, all the phenomena that have been explained previously with the postulate of self-interest and changes in constraints can be rewritten with the law of demand. The law of demand may not be mentioned literally, but it has actually been always applied and followed in any explanation or analysis in economics. And only such economic explanation or analysis is correct when it is consistent with the law of demand, the axiom of economics.\n"},"Lecture09/":{"url":"Lecture09/","title":"Lecture 9: Supply Curve, the Theory of Supply and Demand, the Price Intervention by Government","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 9: Supply Curve, the Theory of Supply and Demand, the Price Intervention by Government\n"},"Lecture09/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture09/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: The Supply Curve","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: The Supply Curve\nThe last lecture is about the law of demand, while this lecture turns to the supply curve.\nSupply curve and demand curve are actually the same curve. Since the theory of producers has not been introduced, let’s temporarily assume a world without production. In the absence of production, why are supply curve and demand curve the same curve? Suppose ABC in Fig. 9-1 is a demand curve for an individual. The point B means that when the price is O’B, the quantity of the good he holds is OO’ (caution: O is the original point where the quantity demanded is zero).  If the price drops from point B, according to the law of demand, he will increase the quantity demanded for the good, which means he moves along BA. On the contrary, if the price rises from point B, he will reduce the quantity demanded. But how? The answer is: sell the good he holds.  That is supply! Using O’B as a mirror, the inverted line of BC can be drawn as BC’ which is exactly a supply curve sloping upwards. So it is clear that supply curve is actually the inverted image of demand curve.\n\n  \n\n\n  Figure 9-1\n\n\nThe economic implication of Fig. 9.1 is whether a person is a buyer or a seller, a consumer or a supplier depends on the price. If the price is low enough, people will choose to be buyers, and the lower the price is, the more they will buy. On the contrary, if the price is high enough, people will choose to be sellers, and the higher the price is, the more they will sell. Supply and demand can transfer from one to the other, depending on the price.\nSince supply curve and demand curve are actually the same curve, the characteristics of supply curve are the same as those of demand curve, such as (1) quantity supplied is an intention, while the quantity of sale is a fact; (2) quantity supplied is different from supply, and the change of the former refers to the movement of a point on the same supply curve, while the change of latter refers to the movement of the whole supply curve. Readers should be able to analogize all of them from demand curve.\n"},"Lecture09/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture09/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Theory of Supply and Demand","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Theory of Supply and Demand\nCombine the demand curve and supply curve, the theory of supply and demand is deduced. As shown in fig. 9-2 where the demand curve and supply curve of different people for a good are drawn in the same graph, the intersection point is P*, the equilibrium price which determines Q*, the equilibrium quantity. Caution: it is the price that determines the quantity, not the reverse, because the price is an independent variable and quantity is a dependent variable. Of course, it has stressed in Lecture 7 that there is problem for the concept of “equilibrium”. Specifically, quantity demanded and supplied are both intentions. Are they equal to each other? God knows. My opinion is: it is always in equilibrium, so quantity demanded is always equal to quantity supplied.\n\n  \n\n\n  Figure 9-2\n\n\nThere is no such thing as disequilibrium, but in order to understand why P* is the equilibrium price, just imagine the so-called disequilibrium when the price is not P*.\nThere are two possibilities of disequilibrium, one is the case when the price is higher than P*, the other is the case when the price is lower than P*.\nWhen the price, such as P’, is higher than P*, the sellers are so willing to sell more of the goods that the quantity supplied is Qs’, while the buyers are so reluctant to buy that the quantity demanded is Qd’. There is oversupply in the market, and only the quantity of Qd’ can be sold out, while the quantity of Qd’ Qs’ cannot. The diagram only tells us that the quantity that can be sold out at the price of P’ is Qd’, but it does not tell whose goods are the “lucky ones” that are those sold out. In other words, the sellers must compete to become the lucky ones. Suppose the qualities of the goods are the same, the sellers can only compete with price by cutting prices to attract buyers, so the price of P’ cannot be stabilized and fall. As the price falls, the sellers’ desire to supply is hit, and some reduce supply, and some even leave the market completely, so the quantity supplied decrease. On the other hand, the buyers’ desire to buy is stimulated, and some has bought increase demand, and some has not bought become to want to buy, so the quantity demanded increase. Thus, the oversupply in the market decreases. However, as long as there is still oversupply, there will be some goods that cannot be sold out, and the competition among the sellers will push them to continue to reduce the price. The price cannot be stabilized until it decreases to P*. Until then the quantity demanded and supplied are both Q*, and all goods can be sold out, so the sellers do not need to reduce the price any more.\nOn the contrary, when the price, such as P’’, is lower than P*, what will happen? Logically similar to the above analysis, it can be deduced that there is over-demand in the market, and only the need within the quantity of Qs’’ can be met. Now it is the buyers who have to compete to become the “lucky ones” by increasing the price. As the price rises, the buyers’ desire to buy is hit, while the sellers’ desire to supply is stimulated, so the over-demand in the market decreases. However, as long as there is still over-demand, there will be some buyers’ needs that have not been met, and the competition among the buyers will push them to continue to increase the price. The price cannot be stabilized until it increases to P*.\nThe above process from disequilibrium to equilibrium is just imagined for logical reasoning. In reality, it is always in equilibrium. If it seems to be in disequilibrium, it must be due to the neglect of transaction costs for both the buyer and seller in adjusting their behaviors, including changing the price or quantity. If there were no transaction costs, all adjustments would be completed in an instant. Precisely because there are transaction costs, it is in equilibrium in every instant.\nWhen other factors have changed, the whole demand curve or supply curve will move, causing the equilibrium to change. In the previous lecture, a large number of such examples have been explained, so it will not be discussed here anymore.\n"},"Lecture09/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture09/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Traditional Analysis of Price Control and Its Problem","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Traditional Analysis of Price Control and Its Problem\nThere are two kinds of government intervention in price: price ceiling and price floor.\n“Price ceiling” refers to the government’s policy or law to repress the price to be lower than the equilibrium price. The price ceiling must be lower than the equilibrium price, otherwise it is meaningless. Price ceiling is also called “price control”.\nIn contrast, “price floor” refers to the government’s policy or law to inflate the price to be higher than the equilibrium price. Price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price, otherwise it is meaningless. Price floor is also called “minimum price” or “price support”.\nBoth price ceiling and price floor are government interventions in price, which are essentially infringements of PPRs. As mentioned briefly before, there are three rights in PPRs: the use right, the right to income and the right to transfer. Among them, the use right and the right to transfer are actually needed to establish the right to income, because only when people can freely use and transfer the goods they hold, can they fully obtain the income from the goods. It is the right to income that is directly infringed by government intervention in price. This good belongs to me. I want to trade it at this price. On what legal basis can the government forbid me? Isn’t it an infringement of my right to income?\nPrice control infringes the seller’s right to income, while price floor attempts to infringe the buyer’s right to income. To say “attempt” means it is actually not successful. Before the transaction, the PPRs of the goods were in the hands of the seller instead of the buyer. The buyer foresaw that his right to income would be infringed after the transaction, and he simply chose not to buy to avoid infringement. Therefore, price floor actually infringes the seller’s PPRs, just not on the right to income right, but on the right to transfer because the seller cannot exercise his right to transfer at such a high price. Of course, when the right to transfer cannot be exercised, the right to income will be inevitably affected, because unless it is in an autarky world where there is no trade, the income from goods is mostly realized by transfer (sale).\nLet’s analyze price control firstly.\nFig.9-3 is the geometric analysis of the consequences of price control in MSE. The equilibrium price is P*, but the government imposes price control to repress it to P’. At such a low price, sellers are reluctant to supply, so the quantity supplied is only Qs’. However, buyers are very willing to buy, so the quantity demanded is as high as Qd’. There is over-demanded in the market, which is called “shortage”. As a result, only the need of Qs’ can be met. In other words, the consequence of price control is that fewer buyers’ needs are met, while sellers’ incomes drop, which can be described as loss at both sides.\n\n  \n\n\n  Figure 9-3\n\n\nHowever, this analysis of MSE is wrong. Because quantity demanded and supplied are both intention, only God knows whether they are equal to each other, and there is no way to test which is more or less than the other. In other words, the so-called “shortage” is not a fact. Attention: the concept of “scarcity” mentioned in Lecture 4 is a fact, because the scarce goods have prices, and the scarcer a good is, the higher its price is, which are all observable facts. But what about “shortage”? There are no observable facts about it. What can be observed in reality is the quantity of purchase and sale, not the quantity demanded and supplied. However, the quantity of purchase is always equal to that of sale, no matter there is price control or not, because they are actually the quantity of transaction: from the buyer’s point of view it is the quantity of purchase, while from the seller’s point of view it is the quantity of sale. Therefore, the analysis on price control of MSE is logically wrong.\nNext, the conclusion of analysis of MSE will be tested by facts. The conclusion is that price control will lead to a decrease price and in quantity demanded which should be referred to quantity of transaction. But really?\nSuppose a landlord rents out a house, and receives RMB1000 a month. Now all of a sudden, the government imposes a rent control of RMB800 a month which is said to help the poor afford to rent a house. What will the landlord do? The economic implication of the analysis of MSE is that he will submit to the price control, but only rent out 80% of the house, which is obviously refuted by facts. In reality, the landlord will try to go round the price control, and get the original price back. There are many ways to achieve it, and the simplest way (with the least transaction cost) is: the landlord rents the house by RMB800 a month in name only, but charges RMB2400 of “contract fee” before signing a one-year lease contract with the tenant. Who refuses to the contract fee, the landlord will not rent the house to him, so he actually collects the same rent of RMB12, 000 a year as before. The problem is if the tenant will accept the extra contract fee. If he accepted the rent of RMB1000 a month before, he would certainly accept the extra contract fee, because the contract fee shared over the 12 months of a year is RMB200, the sum of which and the nominal rent of RMB800 is no different from the original RMB1000. Moreover, what is more important is that in fact there cannot be houses worth RMB1000 in the market that are currently rented in RMB800 without any contract fee. As long as a landlord think of the idea of contract fee to go around the price control and get the rent back, others will get to know, so all landlords will do so, the tenant can only accept the extra contract fee, just as he accepts the equilibrium rent in the market before the imposition of price control.\nIn reality, there is really contract fee. There is rent control in New York. As a result, a tenant has to pay a sum of money called “key money” to buy the key to the house when he moved in, in addition to the namely low rent. How can a tenant enter the house without the key? Therefore, the “key money” is essentially the contract fee mentioned above. There had also been a case in New York that a tenant was required to buy a broken chair at a ridiculously high price which was actually the contract fee again. The Landlords would use various names for contract fee by which took back the rent infringed by government control.\nSimilar phenomena occurred in Hong Kong when rent control was imposed. The landlords in Hong Kong were so imaginative that they invented “shoe money”. It meant that the landlords had been walking around to find the suitable tenants and worn out their shoes, so the tenants should pay them to buy new shoes. Of course, the price was entirely not determined by the actual costs of the shoes themselves, but by the rent infringed by government control.\nLet’s look at another example in reality. There had been oil shocks in the 1970s, and the US government had imposed price control on petroleum for four times in an attempt to curb inflation by suppressing the rise in petroleum price. However, this was actually a drug rather than an antidote, because once the price control had been abolished, the petroleum price would rebound sharply, causing the consumer price index (CPI) to rise again. During the period of price control on petroleum, it was common for cars to line up to wait for refueling. And the petrol stations had also come up with a new trick: cars that refuel and lubricating can have priority to refueling.  Only petrol was subject to price control, while lubricant was not, so the petrol station increased the price of lubricant so that the regulated part of the price of petroleum was transferred to lubricant. It is a kind of tie sale of a good with price control and another good without price control to transfer the regulated part of the price of the former to the latter.\nSome may suggest government should also impose price control on lubricant. It can be expected that the petrol station will change tie sale of petroleum and car washing. What if government also imposes price control on car washing? Again, the petrol station will change to tie sale petroleum and the shopping in the store of the station. Unless the petrol station is nationalize to a state-owned enterprise, it can always “invent” some kinds of tie sale to get back the regulated part of price of petroleum.\nIt should be always remembered that human is self-interested and there is scarcity everywhere, which cannot be changed by price control, so neither can it be changed that there must be competition criterion to deicide winners or losers. Without price control, price criterion is used to determine who can get those scarce goods in competition. With price control, part of the price criterion has been abolished, but the question of who can get the scarce goods by competition is still there. Under different constraints, people will use different ways to solve this question, sometimes going around price control and back to price criterion (such as contract fee or tie sale), sometimes using other non-price criteria (such as queuing) instead. There are numerous ways, which will lead to the “unconstrained” problem mentioned in the introduction of methodology of science in Lecture 2. Therefore, the key of economic analysis on price control is not shortage the MSE is concerned with, but the law that determine what ways people will use to take place of price criterion abolished by price control.\nUnder price control, part of the sellers’ rights to income are infringed by government, but government just forbid them from collecting that part of the price (income) in the former way, and does not clearly stipulate who owns that part of income, so self-interested people (mostly the sellers, but sometimes the buyers) will try their best to grab it (the seller would think that he only took back the income he deserved). In fact, self-interested people are not competing for the scarce goods, but this part of income, because who is the owner of it becomes unclear due to price control. Of course, it must cost much to grab the income, which implies that there is transaction cost. It is also determined by the postulate of self-interest that the way that could grab the most income with the least transaction cost will be used. This is precisely the law that the theory of price control should seek to explain people’s choice under price control.\nIn conclusion, price control is a very complicated issue, involving the ownerless income due to the partial infringement of PPRs, so self-interested people compete for grabbing it which leads to rent dissipation (a kind of transaction cost). However, self-interested people will also try to reduce the loss rent dissipation as much as possible. This issue will be explained once more in detail in the following lecture of “Rent Dissipation”.\n"},"Lecture09/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture09/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: Price Control Causes Transaction Cost to Increase","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: Price Control Causes Transaction Cost to Increase\nAs discussed in the previous section, the analysis of MSE focuses on the so-called shortage is meaningless and has been refuted by facts. There are two other points should be paid attention to about price control. Firstly, some goods are not paid directly at visible price, but indirectly in other ways. If government controls those indirect ways, it is also price control. For example, the time that TV audiences spend on watching advertisements is an indirect price to pay for TV programs, so it is actually a kind of price control if government imposes restriction on TV advertisement.\nSecondly, some think that government regulation is always invalid, which is true seen from the example of rent control. The rent actually paid by the tenant is still RMB1000 a month which is the same as the equilibrium price originally and just is not all in the name of rent, but part of RMB200 as “contract fee”. Judging from whether the government regulation has achieved its original stated goal, price control is totally a failure, so it is an “evil policy” and should not be implemented.\nIt has been discussed in detail in Lecture 5 that the question of “ought to be” belongs to moral ethics, and should not be answered by economics. However, if an objective standard can be specified in advance, and based on which the conclusion of empirical analysis is judged, then it has become normative analysis in economics. Here is a general objective standard for all the normative economics to judge if a government policy is good or bad, that is, if the objective effect of a policy is the original goal it claims to achieve. If it is, it is a “good policy”, while if it is not, it is an “evil policy”. The rent control is a typical example: government claims to implement this policy in order to decrease the rent burden for the poor. However the empirical analysis as mentioned in previous section shows that the tenant pays no less than before. So a normative conclusion can be come to that rent control is an “evil policy” that should not be implemented.\nIn other words, to judge if a policy is good or bad does not depend on what good purpose it claims to achieve, but on what actual effect it results in, which is also a philosophical truth. Economics is a science, but what we can learn from it is not only economic theories, but also the way of thinking and even philosophical truth. Here is: do not judge a person by what he says, but what he does! Do not believe what a person claims as subjective motive of his behavior which is neither credible (only God knows if he has lied) nor important, but observe the objective effect of his behavior. You say you love me, but you love me so much that you kill me! I am afraid that I do not want such love.\nSome may still argue that the effect of rent control is not good just because it is not perfect enough and government should improve the policy by forbidding all kinds of “contract fee”. However, the example of price control on petroleum has shown that the essence of price control is that it infringes PPRs and makes part of the income ownerless. Self-interested human will always try all the means that government never dreams of to grab the ownerless income. The so-called improvement of policy cannot change the relevant key factors of self-interest, scarcity and competition.\nAnd even if government “improves” the price control such that no one can grab the ownerless income, the result is only all the regulated rent dissipates. How can be it good to society? For example, if government has regulated in great detail and nullified all means for collecting “contract fee”, which means in essence that the transaction cost of contract fee increases to be even higher than the regulated rent, what will be the result? Before rent control when the landlord could get RMB1000 a month from the house, he would furnish the house with furniture. Now with rent control, he can only get RMB800 a month and cannot get back the other rents by “contract fee”, so he will only rent an empty house without furniture. Such an empty house could only be rented out in RMB800 a month even when there was no rent control. Thus government’s rent control is still invalid. Or the landlord will no longer repair and maintain the house from now on, so that the house will depreciate to the level consistent with the regulated rent. All the houses worth more than RMB800 a month in the market will eventually disappear, so those who are willing to pay more rent to improve their living conditions no longer find a house good enough to meet their needs even they have money. Does government really want to achieve such a result by rent control?\nIn addition, the government regulation is invalid does not mean that it has no adverse impact on society. From the previous analysis, it can be seen that if government strongly enforces rent control and effectively forbid all kinds of ways going around the regulation such as contract fee, there will be only very bad consequences to society.  However, does government regulation have no negative impact on society when there is contract fee? Self-interested people will compete for the ownerless income due to price control, which will cause transaction cost. Self-interested people will try to minimize the transaction cost which is not zero, so there is an increase in transaction cost in the regulated society compared with the unregulated one.\nTake rent control as an example. When there is no rent control, the cost for the house is RMB1000. When there is rent control, the cost for the house is the sum of RMB800 in the name of rent and RMB200 in the name of contract fee. It seems that there is no difference. However, when there is no regulation, there is only one price to be set by the landlord and tenant (i.e. rent of RMB1000).  After rent control, there are two prices to be set (i. e. rent of RMB800 and the monthly contract fee of RMB200), so there is more transaction cost than before. Of course, the increase in transaction cost here is almost negligible, because the rent of RMB800 is set directly based on the government regulated price, while the contract fee of RMB200 is set based on the difference between the market rent and the regulated price. It is precisely why contract fee is chosen as the least costly way to go around the rent control.\nNevertheless, it is only because in the house leasing market it is easy to find this way that there is little increase in transaction cost under certain constraints. In many cases, it is not so “lucky” under other constraints. Let's turn to the example of price control for petroleum. The gas station get back the regulated price of petroleum by tie sale of it and lubricants and increasing the price of lubricants, which increase much more transaction cost than contract fee in the house leasing market. A car that does not need to be lubricated at all will have to be done so in order to refuel without queuing. It is obviously a waste to be more frequently lubricated than necessarily, which implies transaction cost. And some will choose not to let their cars be lubricated but to queue up. By standing there and waiting idly, no one can benefit from the cost of time, which is a greater waste. It means that the transaction cost of queuing is higher than that of using too much lubricant. That is why the gas station encourages customers to choose lubricant. However, different people have different cost of time, so there are still a considerable number of people who think queuing is a better choice. In short, under the constraints faced by the gas station, the transaction cost caused by price control for petroleum has been kept as low as possible, but it is still obviously higher than that in the house leasing market.\nIn fact, neither does the story in the house leasing have a happy ending. When government finds that contract fee is used to invalidate the rent control, it will come up with various supplementary policies to prohibit contract fee. Under this new constraint, the landlord has to think of new countermeasures which will definitely increase transaction cost, maybe to be even be much higher than that caused by tie sale of petroleum and lubricants in the price control for petroleum. Thus, although government regulation is always invalid, it does not mean that it has no adverse impact on society which refers to an increase in transaction cost.\nThere are two reasons for government to implement “evil policy”: one is ignorance, the other is impudence. On the one hand, government may neither know the regulation will be only invalid, nor that if it tries to strengthen the regulation, it will only cause an increase in transaction cost. On the other hand, government is only a virtual concept, and it is government officials who are really alive, and they are also human and self-interested. They implement price control not because they are ignorant, nor because they really want help the poor (i.e., their claimed purpose is in fact just a pretense), but because regulation gives them power. When there is regulation, it is necessary to establish an organization (such as the Housing Department for rent control) to increase government spending which can feed or even fatten many government officials. In Lecture 2, it has been reminded that economics is a social science, which causes much trouble compared with a natural science: one is ignorance which leads to wrong application of economics, but the biggest trouble is that economists are also human and self-interested, and will deliberately distort economic analysis to deceive the public and benefit themselves. Those in favor of price control are mostly the laymen of economics who are ignorant, but some are economists. They have studied economics and still support price control, few of whom may be as ignorant as the laymen and should retake the course of economic, but I am afraid most of whom are imprudent.\nSome may sympathize with the poor, and ask, “Without price control, what can the poor who cannot afford the price in the market do?” Firstly, from the above analysis, it is clear that price control cannot help the poor, but will only increase the transaction cost and make the whole society poorer.\nSecondly, as long as the transaction cost is low enough, the market can satisfy any needs of all kinds of people (including the poor, of course). For example, many live under the same roof the share the rent, or a house is divided into several small single rooms which are rented separately, or even just a bed is rented out. The market will always supply goods of different quality according to different capacities of paying, and satisfy all kinds of demands. There is a saying that “big chickens do not eat small rice”, which means that big businessmen disdain to earn small money and therefore disdain to serve small customers. However, in reality, big chickens eat big rice, small chickens eat small rice, and even broken rice is eaten by worms. As long as there is rice, no matter how small it is, there will always be someone to eat it. As long as there is money, no matter how small it is, there will always someone to earn it. Therefore, as long as there is demand, there will be always supply and there will be always a market to take care of the demand. It is important for government not to interfere, misunderstanding that it can help the poor by preventing sellers from earning money which only results in strangling the supply for the demand.\n"},"Lecture09/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture09/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: Minimum Wage Laws Cause Unemployment","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: Minimum Wage Laws Cause Unemployment\nAs seen in the last section, the actual effect of price control that sets a price ceiling is so terrible, and what about price floor that sets a minimum price? It may seem contradictory for government to implement price floor to forbid low price while it implements price control that is claimed to help the poor who cannot afford the high price at the same time. Again it is the poor who are used as an excuse by government to implement price floor, because the price floor is mostly common implemented in the labor market and agriculture products market where the suppliers are labors and farmers who have always been regarded as the poor. Thus, minimum wage laws and agricultural price supports are the most typical price floors.\nLet us look at the analysis of MSE first. Fig.9-4 shows the consequence of price floor. The equilibrium price in the market is P*, but government imposes price floor to inflate it to P’’. At such a high price, buyers are reluctant to buy, so the quantity demanded is only Qd’’. However, sellers are very willing to supply, so the quantity supplied is as high as Qs’’. There is oversupply in the market, which is called “surplus”. As a result, only the quantity of Qd’’ can be sold out. In other words, the consequence of price floor is fewer sellers’ goods are sold out.\nThere is the same problem in this analysis of MSE as that for price control. The quantity demanded and supplied are both intentions, so the so-called “surplus” is not a fact which cannot be tested. Only based on specific constraints can be there meaningful economic analysis. Fortunately, price floor is generally only imposed in the labor market and agriculture products market, so let us analyze them one by one.\n\n  \n\n\n  Figure 9-4\n\n\nMinimum wage laws are generally analyzed in the part about factor markets in economic textbooks, but the relevant analysis actually applies the TSD here. If we specifically designate the variable of price as the wage rate, and the variable of quantity as the employment of labor force, we can easily change Fig.9-4 to Fig.9-5. It can be seen clearly in Fig.9-5 that when minimum wage laws set the minimum wage of W’ above the equilibrium wage of W, there will be unemployment of LdLs. There are two sources for the unemployment of LdLs: one is that the rise in the wage rate causes the boss to dismiss the workers of LdL\\, which means the quantity demanded for labor falls; the other is that the rise in the wage rate causes those who did not work before also come out to look for jobs, which means the quantity supplied of labor rise, so increase the unemployment of L*Ls.\n\n  \n\n\n  Figure 9-5\n\n\nYes, there is only one reason for unemployment: the wage rate is too high! It may sound hard to accept, but it is ruthless true. As long as the wage rate is low enough, a person with normal working ability can always have a job. He is unemployed just because he refused to accept the job that he thinks the wage is too low. \nUnemployment is generally regarded as an issue of macroeconomics, but it is necessary to do some basic analysis here. Firstly, the definition of unemployment is problematic. What is unemployment? In macroeconomics, there is no clear and testable definition of unemployment.  If those who do not have a job are unemployed, then a housewife who does not go out to work is unemployed, which is ridiculous. A rich kid needs not work and can still live well, so he idles around all day. Is he unemployed? Obviously, this kind of unemployment include housewives and idle rich kids is irrelevant with the macroeconomic problem government should care about.\nTherefore, macroeconomists divide unemployment into voluntary one and involuntary one. Voluntary unemployment refers to the cases such as housewives and rich kids mentioned above, which is not a problem to solve, while involuntary unemployment is. However, again what is involuntary unemployment? Here is a job of working 24 hours a day with the wage of only RMB1. It is hard to imagine anyone would accept this job, but those who refuse it are “voluntarily” unemployed literally.\nAgain, macroeconomists are busy in revising the definition of involuntary unemployment as that the labor force cannot find a job at the wage level he is willing to accept. However, this definition is still problematic. Some says he is willing to accept a job with the wage of RMB100 trillion, and there cannot be such a high-paid job in this world. Is he involuntary unemployment? To define unemployment as voluntary or involuntary means to use psychological factors to explain the unemployment phenomenon, which is non-scientific as discussed in Lecture 8 of “the Law of Demand” about the prohibition of using psychological factors for explanation in economics. In other words, in macroeconomics there has been no scientific definition of unemployment.\nHowever, if seen from the perspective of ordinary goods, it is not such a difficult problem. That a labor is unemployed is equivalent to that a good cannot be sold out. As long as it is somewhat useful, it is impossible to be unable to be sold out by cutting the price. Even scrap metal, old books and newspapers can be sold out at a price low enough. Thus, the price is too high relative to its use, which is the only reason why it cannot be sold out.\nIt is true for labor force. As can be seen from fig.9-5, the minimum wage of W’ is too high compared with the equilibrium wage of W, which is the only reason for the unemployment of LdLs. If wage is allowed to drop to W, on the one hand, the number of L*Ls will choose to withdraw from the labor market, which means they will become housewives or rich kids voluntarily unemployed. They are those who ask for relatively higher wage, so if the wage offered by the market cannot meet their requirements, they will rather choose not to work. Take a housewife as an example, she will choose to work as long as the wage she gets from the market is so high that she can afford to hire a nanny to take care of the children and do housework for her. It is logically similar to a rich kid. If the market pays him tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, why does he not come out to work? Just because generally the market will not offer him such a high wage, he chooses to be unemployed voluntarily.\nOn the other hand, employers will increase their quantity demanded of LdL* for labor force. When the minimum wage is too high, employers will not employ these people because they are not worth the price. As pointed out earlier, the essence of price floor is trying to infringe buyer's right to income right, which is foreseen by buyers before the transaction, so buyers simply choose not to buy to avoid the infringement. So what is actually infringed is the right to transfer of sellers. Yes, government can impose a higher price, but it cannot force sellers to buy something that they think not worth that high price. As a result, the good with price floor cannot be sold out, which is precisely unemployment in the labor market. In other words, the essence of minimum wage law is an infringement of the right to transfer of the labor force, not allowing workers to rent out their labors at a price lower than the regulated minimum wage, and it actually deprives workers of their right to work!\nThe objective effect of government’s policy is once again contrary to its stated good purpose: the minimum wage laws claim to help the poor obtain higher incomes, but in fact make them unemployed and lose the meager incomes they could have obtained. The minimum wage laws claim to protect the interests of workers, but in fact infringe the PPRs of the labor ability which is the only asset a worker may have. Moreover, it is low-wage people who suffer most, because the minimum wage laws only have effective impact on those whose equilibrium wage rates are lower than the regulated rate. The following reading material “Do Minimum-Wage Laws Reduce Employment?” has listed the results of the relevant studies: from rich and large countries like the US, to poor countries like Kenya, to small countries like Singapore, all experiences show that minimum wage laws have reduced employment, and it is low-wage people who suffer most from unemployment caused by minimum wage laws. Faced with such eloquent facts, how can anyone doubt about the conclusion?\n\nREADING MATERIAL: DO MINIMUM-WAGE LAWS REDUCE EMPLOYMENT?1\nEconomists, at least up to recently, have believed that in most labor markets the evidence supports the competitive model. A minimum wage, set higher than the previous equilibrium level, would be expected to reduce employment among the affected low-wage groups. The table here indicates some of the results of a study by Donald Deere, Kevin M. Murphy, and Finis Welch dealing with minimum wage increases legislated in 1990 and 1991.\n Percent employment reduction after 1990–1 minimum wage Increases\n\n\n\nAge group\n% low wage\n% employment change\n\n\n\n\n Men \n\n\n15-19\n44.5\n-15.6\n\n\n20-24\n14.2\n-5.7\n\n\n25-64\n3.3\n-2.4\n\n\n65-69\n14.0\n-4.2\n\n\n Women\n\n\n15-19\n51.8\n-13.0\n\n\n20-24\n19.0\n-4.2\n\n\n25-64\n8.8\n-0.3\n\n\n65-69\n21.0\n+3.1\n\n\n\n Source: Extracted from Deere, Murphy, and Welch, p. 48.\nThe table shows that age-sex groups with the highest proportions of low-wage workers –most notably the 15–19 age groups – generally suffered the largest proportionate reductions in employment. This is exactly what the competitive model would predict. (A possible exception was women 65–69, but only a small percentage of this group was employed to begin with.) The investigators also found large employment drops across other demographic groups with high proportions of low-wage workers, among them African-Americans and persons of Mexican descent.\nFurthermore, the U.S. results confirming the competitive model have generally been supported by experiences with minimum wages in countries as different as Great Britain, Singapore, and Kenya.5\nAs an interesting exception, however, a study by David Card and Alan Krueger obtained results in conflict with the competitive model.6 The competitive theory predicts that an increase in the New Jersey minimum wage would reduce employment of low-wage workers in New Jersey relative to the neighboring state of Pennsylvania, but if anything the opposite was found. 7\n\nFrom this analysis we can again learn another philosophy: do not expect government to help you, it cannot not help you, but even harm you! Whether government is ignorant or impudent, the objective effect is that it cannot help you.\nIn fact, all macroeconomists (including Keynes) admit that the direct cause of unemployment is the too high wage. Various theories about unemployment theory in macroeconomics are just trying to explain why the wage is too high and why the market cannot reduce the wage. However, these macroeconomists are simply unwilling to face the reality that there are minimum wage laws and strong trade unions in western countries that block the wage to be adjusted downwards, thus directly nullifying the market’s function of equalizing the supply and demand with price change.  There are other complicated aspects of unemployment which will be explained in the later lecture.\nThere are still some key points that need to be discussed about minimum wage laws. Firstly, some argue that minimum wage laws will not cause unemployment. Suppose the enterprise need 100 persons for its operation without minimum wage laws. When a minimum wage law is imposed, according which no one’s wage can be less than what the minimum wage law stipulates, and the enterprise still need 100 persons to maintain its operation, so it has to employ all the labors as before, and no one will be fired.\nIt is so foolish to think so! There are many ways for enterprise to reduce the demand for labor, such as increasing labor intensity. During the financial tsunami of 2008, a reporter interviewed the security guard of a factory. He said the boss fired the cleaner and required him to undertake the cleaning job along with his original responsibility. Although he was not unemployed and got the same wage as before, he were responsible for two jobs, which was actually a disguised wage cut.  If there were no minimum wage laws, the cleaner would keep his job with a wage cut, and the security guard would also keep his workload unchanged with a wage cut. However, with minimum wage laws hindering the wage cut, the cleaner who had the lowest wage loses his job and the security guard increases his workload as a disguised wage cut. What’s more, why must the enterprise maintain its original scale of operation? It can downsize the operation, and so cut some jobs to avoid the increase of labor costs caused by minimum wage laws. In extreme cases, it can even go bankrupt and reduce the number of employment to zero!\nSecondly, in reality, the immediate response of the enterprise affected by minimum wage laws is generally not to dismiss employees, but to reduce or even stop recruiting new employees, because it is more troublesome (i.e. higher transaction cost) for the former than the latter. In other words, it is not those who have jobs but those who are looking for jobs that bear the brunt of the impact of minimum wage laws, which means that graduates just leaving schools suffer most. Indeed, the unemployment rate of young people is relatively high. However, if the minimum wage continues to rise or the performance of economy becomes worse, the enterprise will increase labor intensity as a disguised wage cut as mentioned just now. Finally, some employees will be fired, and those who are least worth or whose equilibrium wages differ most from what minimum wage laws stipulate will be the first to be fired.\nThirdly, some will doubt if the market is free to determine the wage, those with the worst working ability may get so little income that they cannot make ends meet. What should we help them? It is similar to the worry that the poor cannot not afford to rent a house without rent control, so the answer is also similar. According to the analysis above, minimum wage laws cannot help those with the worst working ability to get higher wages, but only make them unemployed and have not any income at all. In contrast, as long as it is not interfered by government’s evil policies, with the minimum wage determined by the market, the poor is sure to be able to make ends meet, because the prices of a worker's products and his wage are related to each other. On the one hand, the later lecture on the income distribution will point out that a worker's wage is determined by the prices of his products instead of the boss who employs him. On the other hand, the wages of workers will in turn affect the prices of products. If the wages of workers are low, the prices of products will be low too, so the expenses needed by workers to make ends meet will fall. If the wages of workers are too low to make ends meet, there will not be enough purchasing power to support the prices of products. The rich will not consume a large amount of products used for living, and will not compete with the poor for these products, so it is the poor’s consumption that determined the prices of them. In other words, the prices will fall until the poor can afford to make ends meet. That is why the minimum wage determined by the market must be enough to make the poor survive.\n\n\n1.

Government can force enterprises to pay high wages through minimum wage laws, but cannot force consumers to buy agricultural products at high prices. In order to implement agricultural price supports, government has to purchase all the agricultural products that are so expensive that no one will buy in the market. Imagine what would happen if this kind of government purchase were used in the labor market. Government does not enact minimum wage laws, but establishes state-owned enterprises to recruit workers with higher wages than those offered by private enterprises. Obviously, people will flock to apply for state-owned enterprises, which forces private enterprises to follow and raise the wages to the same level, or else they cannot recruit any workers.\nThere are two direct effects of agricultural price supports: firstly, government must pay for a large number of so-called “surplus” agricultural products; secondly, agricultural products in the market are extremely “scarce”, so the prices are extremely high. Government can solve the latter problem by supplying the agricultural products it buys at a high price to the market at a low price or for free. As a result, there are phenomena such as free lunch for students and food aid used as a diplomatic tool in the US.\nBy the way, is free lunch really free? Do not forget that government is not an enterprise, so it does not produce to earn income, and its income comes from taxes which are collected from taxpayers. The so-called free lunch provided by government is in fact indirectly paid by taxpayers.  Taxpayers are forced to pay no matter whether they have children in schools or not, no matter whether they are willing to pay for the lunch or not. If one pays directly for the lunch, he will assure the quality is good enough for the price they pay. He may be willing to choose better or worse (with lower price) quality than that of the free lunch. Now government has made a choice on his behalf. Is it possible that government cares more about his children and makes a better choice than he does? For the suppliers of the free lunch, if customers pay directly, the saying that “customer is god” is not an empty moral sermon, but the truth supported by money. However, if customers pay indirectly through government, it is government that is god. The suppliers only care about how to please government (strictly speaking, government officials), rather than how to provide the free lunch good and cheap to please customers.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: AGRICULTURAL PRICE SUPPORTS1\nSince the 1930s the U.S. government has attempted to maintain “parity” prices for agricultural products. Parity means the relationship between agricultural and nonagricultural prices that obtained during the years 1910 and 1914, a period of farm prosperity. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, high parity price ﬂoors were maintained by government purchases. A federal agency, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), would buy any otherwise unsold quantities of supported crops at the support level usually at 90% of the parity price.\nThe “surpluses” purchased by the CCC were mostly stored; the federal government hoped to sell them in years of small harvests. But the amount produced almost every year was greater than the amount consumers would purchase at the artificially high supported prices. By 1960 the CCC held in storage as much wheat as that year’s entire crop.\nTo reduce the cost of holding such huge stores, Congress passed food stamp and school lunch programs subsidizing food prices for some consumers. A variety of “supply management” programs were introduced to reduce quantities produced. In addition, the price support levels were reduced. The table shows that, accordingly, in the 1960s government purchases were much smaller than in the previous decade.\n Yearly acquisitions of three supported crops by the commodity credit corporation, selected years\n\n\n\nGrain\nSorghum\nCorn\nWheat\n\n\n\n\n1953\n40.9\n422.3\n486.1\n\n\n54\n110.1\n250.6\n391.6\n\n\n55\n92.6\n408.9\n276.7\n\n\n56\n32.5\n477.4\n148.4\n\n\n57\n279.6\n268.1\n193.5\n\n\n58\n258\n266.6\n511\n\n\n1963\n125.1\n17.9\n85.1\n\n\n64\n66.8\n29.1\n86.9\n\n\n65\n85\n11.2\n17.2\n\n\n66\n0.3\n12.4\n12.4\n\n\n67\n9.1\n191\n90\n\n\n68\n13.7\n34.4\n182.9\n\n\n\n Source: Commodity Credit Corporation charts, November 1972, pp. 49, 75, 115.\nOver the years, political support for the policy of buying surpluses has declined. Instead, a variety of other techniques for maintaining farm prices have been increasingly used, the details varying from commodity to commodity. Generally speaking, these restrict either the number of acres that can be planted or the amount of product that can be sold. Such methods of “supply management” have been supplemented by other programs aimed at maintaining farm incomes, among them direct payments to farmers for acres not planted or for crops not sold.\n\nGovernment forces enterprises to bear the economic burden of minimum wage laws, while it has to bear the economic burden of agricultural price supports by itself. Therefore, government has been trying to get out of this trap it accidentally fell into, but hardly succeeds. The following reading material of “Agricultural Price Supports” shows how the US government has struggled for decades: firstly to reduce the level of price supports, then to restrict farmers’ planting areas in an attempt to reduce agricultural outputs. However, under the stimulus that the supported prices are still higher than the equilibrium prices, farmers have also played the trick of going around the restrictions: when government forbids them to increase the planting areas, they will use all kinds of means to increase the outputs per unit area. Finally, the U.S. government has to directly limit the amount of agricultural products that farmers can sell at the high prices set by price supports.\nIn fact, for European and US governments, there are mainly two mountains that have overwhelmed their finances and plunged them into sovereign debt crisis, one of which is precisely the fiscal expenditures on agricultural price supports. The other one is social security on retirement pension, which will be analyzed later in this book.\n\n\n1.

In consumer theory, there are two axioms (comparison axiom and transitivity axiom), a concept of “utility” and an analysis by using indifferent curves, with which a price expansion path due to price changes are drawn to deduce a demand curve. Nevertheless, with the disturbance of the Giffen good, this demand curve cannot be sure to slope downwards, so it is necessary to assume that there is no Giffen good. In short, if the explanatory power of consumer theory is as strong as the law of demand, there must be much more contents, which make the theory extremely complicated.\nAccording to “Occam’s Razor” in the methodology of science introduced in Lecture 8, the law of demand is obviously better than consumer theory. What’s more, the concept of utility and indifferent curve, on which consumer theory depends deeply, are both intentions. When applying them to explain phenomena, one must first try to find observable facts to replace them, which also make the applications much more complicated. There are traps of tautology easily to fall into.\nFurthermore, in practical application, the explanatory power of the law of demand law is much stronger than consumer theory. As pointed out in the last section of Lecture 8, if the variable of “price” is interpreted broadly as “cost”, not only the behaviors of consumers but also of producers can be explained. If it is further interpreted as “constraint”, the law of demand can actually explain all human’s behaviors. That is why the law of demand is not just an ordinary theory but an axiom in economics.\nIn fact, there is no need for practitioners to learn consumer theory. Then why do I still write this lecture? Because this theory is strong in logic, and it is good for training the logical thinking. However, if you want to explain phenomena, do not expect consumer theory to be helpful, and the law of demand is much simpler and more useful.\n"},"Lecture10/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Two Axioms of Consumer Theory","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Two Axioms of Consumer Theory\nThere are two axioms in consumer theory, both of which are postulates about human’s preference (the same as “taste”). One is the axiom of comparison: a person can compare any two baskets A and B of commodities. Such a comparison must lead to one of the three following results: he or she (i) prefers basket A over B, or (ii) prefers basket B over A, or (iii) is indifferent between A and B.\nThe other is the axiom of transitivity: consider any three baskets A, B, and C. If a consumer prefers A to B, and also prefers B to C, he or she must prefer A to C. Similarly, a person who is indifferent between A and B, and is also indifferent between B and C, must be indifferent between A and C.\nThese two axioms taken together lead to the proposition of rank ordering of preference: a consumer can consistently rank all baskets of commodities in order of preference. This ranking is called “the preference function.”\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-1\n\nBased on the above axioms, proposition and the definition of “goods” introduced in Lecture 4, we can draw the Fig.10-1. The x-axis and y-axis respectively represent the quantity of good X and good Y, and any point in the rectangular coordinate is a basket of different quantities of these two goods. For example, the x-coordinate of point A represents the quantity of good X in the basket A, while the y-coordinate is the quantity of good Y. According to the above axioms, laws and the definition of “goods”, we can judge that point A is preferred to D, because it contains more of X and Y than D does. It is the preference ranking for the two goods according to the proposition of rank ordering of preference.\nHowever, here is the question: which is better, point B or point C? How to rank their orders? The quantity of Y at point B is more than that at point C, while the quantity of X at point B is less than that at point C. The former means B is preferred to C, but the latter means C is preferred to B, which implies that only with the above axioms, proposition and the definitions of “goods”, the constraints are not enough to infer human’s behavior of choosing which basket of goods between B and C.\nThe answer to this question is the analysis tool of “indifference curve” which will be derived in the later section.\n"},"Lecture10/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Use Value VS Utility — Methodology of Science (3): What is measure in science?","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Use Value VS Utility — Methodology of Science (3): What is measure in science?\nBefore deriving indifference curve, a concept of “utility” should be discussed first. What is utility? Chinese students all have learned Marxist economics in middle school. There is a concept of “use value” in Marxist economics, which is not invented by Marx, but by Adam Smith and is widely used by classical economists. “Use value” is actually a very good concept, but it was invented along with the “theory of labor value” which was refuted by facts and abandoned now, so it is also abandoned and replaced by the concept of “utility” which is worse than it.\nThe concept of “utility” was invented by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), a British philosopher, who was famous for his philosophy of “utilitarianism”. This concept was introduced into economics by the economists who initiated the marginal revolution, and replaced the concept of “use value”. However, economists have completely changed the original meaning of utility which meant the pursuit of happiness and avoidance of pain in utilitarianism advocated by Bentham.\nNow in economics, utility is a measurement of human’s preference for goods, which means it is used to measure the psychological factor of preference, so it is not a fact, and if directly applied to explain phenomena there will be the mistake of tautology. In order to avoid the trap of tautology, we have to look for the objective constraints that cause the psychological factor of preference, which means we must ask: why does a person prefer a specific good? The answer is because the good can meet some of his needs, which simply means that the good has “use value” for him!\nIn other words, “use value” is directly related to objective constraints and is a fact, while “utility” is directly related to psychological factor of preference and is not a fact. Compared with “use value”, when “utility” is applied in explanation, it is either easy to fall into the trap of tautology, or we need to look for objective constraints to replace the psychological factors, which is too long-winded and against “Occam’s Razor” in methodology of science, so it is not a good concept. However, utility is easy to use mathematics to represent, so it is widely used in academic papers of economics. How much there is empty economic paper just filled with utility analysis in the form of mathematical equations nowadays!\nTherefore, we advocate abandoning the concept of “utility” which is good-looking but empty, and returning to the concept of “use value” which is simple but objective.\nHowever, in the concept of “use value” advocated by Adam Smith (and Marx), there is a major mistake which must be corrected. In Smith’s view, the same good has the same use value for different people. In fact, the use value of the same good can be completely different for different people, times and places. For example, when I am a teacher, and I keep talking all the class, so I need to take water which is of high use value to me. But for the students who just sit and listen most of the time, water is not absolutely necessary and of low use value. Therefore, the use value of water is different for different people, which does not mean it is psychological.\nFurthermore, the use value of water can be different at different times and in different places. Suppose one is in the desert without water, and another one appears in front of him with a bottle of water. How much would he like to spend to buy the water? The answer is: he would be willing to give all his money in exchange. The use value of the water now is so high for him under such circumstances that it is equivalent to the value of life!\nBy the way, there is also a concept of “exchange value” in Marxist economics (actually in classical economics) which is distinguished from price. However this distinguish is meaningless, and exchange value is the same as price. Of course, there is relationship between price (exchange value) and use value (utility), but not the kind of relationship advocated by Marxist economics, which will be discussed in the later lecture.\nEarly economists thought utility could be measured quantitatively, which means it was cardinal magnitude. However, later they found that utility could only be ordinal magnitude. Cardinal magnitude is one, two, three ..., which can be used for four fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example, the length is cardinal magnitude, so it can be calculated that a rope of 3 meters is 2 meters longer than a rope of 1 meter, and the two ropes are 4 meters long in total when connected. And ordinal magnitude is the first, second, third ..., which can only be sorted, but cannot be used for four fundamental operations. What is the first plus the third? It cannot be the fourth.\nSince ordinal magnitudes can only be sorted but not be used for four fundamental operations, cardinal magnitudes are often used to replace them. For example, in the beauty contests mentioned above, the judges will give scores to each contestant. The scores are cardinal magnitudes which can not only be sorted, but also be used for four fundamental operations. Suppose the champion’s score is 90 points, the second runner-up’s is 85 points and the third runner-up’s is 70 points, the gap between the champion and the second runner-up is smaller than that between the second runner-up and the third runner-up. However, these scores are only for the convenience of summing up the contestants’ performances in different contest sections to get a final result. So they do not really reflect the gap between the different runners-up. When an ordinal magnitude is replaced with a cardinal magnitude for convenience of operation, we must be very careful not to mistakenly include the properties that the ordinal magnitude does not have but are included in the cardinal magnitude. That is why the utility theory is full of traps. In addition to the aforementioned problem that utility is intention and cannot be directly used to explain phenomena, there is also risk of making mistakes when economists use mathematics to express utility. Do not forget that utility is ordinal magnitude rather than cardinal one, so the four fundamental operations may not be appropriate in analysis.\nHere is the third part of the methodology of science in this book: what is measure in science? As for “measurement”, those who do not understand MS generally have two interrelated misunderstandings: firstly, they think that only what is measureable is scientific. Secondly, they think there is only cardinal measurement. The combination of these two misunderstanding leads to the wrong conclusion that only “quantitative analysis” (as opposed to “qualitative analysis”) is accurate or “measurable”, and is scientific. Marx made such a mistake, saying that “only by making full use of mathematics can any science reach a perfect state”, which is totally wrong from the perspective of MS. As has been explained in Lecture 2, it is “refutability” that is the essential characteristic of science, while mathematics is not science, which is only a tool that can but not must be used to assist in the logical reasoning in the second stage of science. Further, mathematics is not equivalent to measurement which is statistics! What’ s more, there is not only quantitative analysis or cardinal measurement. There have been three mistakes of disguised replacement of concept here: to replace the concept of science with mathematics, to replace the concept of mathematics with statistics, and to replace the concept of statistics with quantitative analysis, which results in the replacement of truth with accuracy appeared by quantitative analysis. It is precisely the so-called “accurately false”.\nIn recent years, there have been such accurately false developments in many social sciences, which is exactly economics that has firstly abused mathematics. Economics is closest to natural science in social science because Adam Smith, the founder of economics, found the postulate of “self-interest” as the first stage of science, and Marshall introduced mathematics into economics as a tool to assist logical reasoning in the second stage of science. It is clear that all Marshall did with mathematics were qualitative analysis, so he knew very well that mathematics is not equal to cardinal measurement. It is on the third stage of fact tests that economics unknowingly went astray.  Economists who do not understand MS see that in the second stage mathematics is widely used, just like natural science, they mistakenly think that in the third stage economics also needs quantitative analysis, just like natural science. Science requires fact tests, but it has never required that only data are facts. Natural science can do experiments in laboratories, so data are generally facts, and most of them are cardinal magnitudes. In contrast, social science is the study on human beings and cannot do experiments in laboratories, which will be explained in detail in the later lecture of “concept of cost”, so data are not necessarily equal to facts. What’s more, the data suitable for describing human behaviors are generally ordinal magnitudes instead of cardinal ones. Take the beauty contests mentioned above as an example. The champion got the highest score of 90 points, the runner-up 85 points, and the third runner-up 70 points. These three cardinal magnitudes are only meaningful in ranking orders.\nNowadays, in many social sciences, econometric (statistical) analysis is widely used as fact tests to show that they are scientific. However, social science cannot do experiments, and there are too few social statistical data, so many studiers use “questionnaire survey” to obtain enough data. In questionnaires, there are full of such question: “do you think something is (a) very important; (b) important; (c) less important; (d) completely unimportant,” and then arbitrarily assign each option such 10 points for (a) and 7 points for item (b) ... and then sum up these cardinal magnitudes which are only meaning full in sorting. If only the summation results are sorted to show whether most think that something is the first or the second important just like the winners order in beauty contests, it makes some sense. After all, it is still back to the nature of ordinal magnitude, although the logical reliability of the summation in the intermediate stage is very doubtful. It is worse that some studiers directly put the data obtained from the summation of the ordinal magnitudes so suspiciously into the regression equation, and make a “student’s t test” or something like that, then claim that the theory has been tested ... They ignore the ordinal nature of the data which are used for four fundamental operations. No matter scientists respecting facts or mathematicians respecting strict logics will never admit what they do is scientific or logic. However, there are full of such so-called test which is neither scientific nor mathematical in all kinds of academic publications in social sciences. What is the difference between them and pseudo-science by cheaters?\nIn the third stage of science, to be “roughly true” is much preferred to “accurately false”. Precision is not equal to truth, and accurate mistakes are pseudo-science in essence, which is worse than non-science! Non-science, such as religious belief, ethics, mathematical logics, also has its significance in some aspects, while pseudo-science is pure fraud. The “roughly true” conclusions come from ordinal measurement which seems not very accurate from the perspective of cardinality, but is logically reliable. As for how to use ordinal measurement, the “marginal analysis” introduced in lecture 7 is a powerful tool.\n"},"Lecture10/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: Indifference Curve","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: Indifference Curve\nWith the concept of use value (utility), we can go back to solve the problem of ranking the different baskets of goods. Looking back at the fig.10-1 in section 1, each point in the rectangular coordinates is a unique basket of good X and Y, and one can rank these points (baskets of goods) by their use values to him. If he thinks that the use values of the baskets represented by points of B and C are the same, a curve called “indifference curve” can be drawn to through them. Similarly, two other indifference curves can be drawn through point A and D respectively. So the fig.10-1 in section 1 is turned to fig.10-2 here.\nIndifference curve has four crucial properties.\n(1)    Difference curve has negative slope, which means it is a curve sloping downwards. As shown in Fig.10-2, since point A is preferred to D, a curve passing through these two points and sloping upwards cannot be an indifference curve. Because both X and Y are goods of which more is preferred to less, it is necessary to decrease the quantity of the other good, when the quantity of one good increases and the use value of the basket muse be kept unchanged. In other words, the points with the same use value must move along a curve where the quantity of one good increases and that of the other good decreases. It means the slope of this curve must be negative.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-2\n\n(2)    Indifference curves never intersect, which can be proved by reduction in mathematics. Assume tentatively that two indifference curves such as U1 and U2 do actually intersect at point A in Fig.10-3. Points A and C are both on U1, which means the consumer is indifferent between them. Points A and B are both on U2, which means the consumer is indifferent between them. By the axiom of transitivity, the consumer must be indifferent between B and C, which means they should be on the same indifference curve, but in fact they are not. So the initial assumption is invalid, and indifference curves cannot intersect.\n\n  \n\n Figure 10-3\n\n(3)    The use values of points on the same indifference curve are the same, but the use values of points on different indifference curves is certainly different. How to determine which one has higher use value? The answer is: the indifference curve farther away from the origin has higher use value. The proof is as followed: As shown in fig.10-2, it is obvious that the indifference curve through point A is farther away from the origin than the curve through points B and C, while the indifference curve through point D is closer to the origin than the curve through points B and C. Because point A is preferred to points B and C, the indifference curve through A, which is farther away from the origin, has a higher use value. In contrast, both points B and C are preferred to point D, so the indifference curve through B and C, which is closer to the origin, has lower use value.\nThe use values of points on the same indifference curve are the same, but the use values of points on different indifference curves is certainly different. How to determine which one has higher use value? The answer is: the indifference curve farther away from the origin has higher use value. The proof is as followed: As shown in fig.10-2, it is obvious that the indifference curve through point A is farther away from the origin than the curve through points B and C, while the indifference curve through point D is closer to the origin than the curve through points B and C.  Because point A is preferred to points B and C, the indifference curve through A, which is farther away from the origin, has a higher use value. In contrast, both points B and C are preferred to point D, so the indifference curve through B and C, which is closer to the origin, has lower use value.\n(4)    Indifference curve is convex to the origin. According to (1), indifference curve must be sloping downwards. The indifference curves in left and right panels of Fig.10-4 are both sloping downwards, but the shapes are different. The one in the left panel is convex to the origin, while the one in the right panel is concave to the origin. The one in the left panel is based on the well-established empirical principle of “diversity in consumption”, while the one in the right panel comes from “unity in consumption”.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-4\n\n\nWe can choose two points A and B on the indifference curve of U1 in both panels of Fig.10-4, and connect these two points with a straight line, then take the middle point C through which draw another indifference curve of U2 tangent to the line AB. It is clear that use value represented by U2 is higher than U1 in the left panel, while lower in the right panel. Obviously, the quantity of two goods in point C is more balanced than that in points A and B. The straight line connecting points A and B is (relative) price line for the two goods, which will be explained in the later section. The left panel means that at a certain price, people think it is better to consume the two goods in a balanced way (represented by point C) than in an extreme way (represented by point A with too much Y and point B with too much X). In contrast, the right panel means that at a certain price, people think it is better to consume the two goods in an extreme way than in a balanced way. The left panel is supported by people’s consumption behaviors in reality, so indifference curve should be convex to the origin.\nIn Lecture 8, complements and substitutes have been introduced, and their indifference curves are drawn in the left and right panels of Fig.10-5 respectively. The indifference curve of perfect substitutes is a straight line, while that of perfect complements is a right angle. Most of goods in reality are between these two extremes, so the indifference curve of two goods is generally a curve convex to the origin.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-5\n"},"Lecture10/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Optimum of the Consumer","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Optimum of the Consumer\nIn the above sections, only the postulates of consumer theory on human’s intentions or preferences are discussed. In order to further find the optimum of the consumer or the consumption equilibrium, constraints must be included. Indifference curves only provide the following information: the consumer is indifferent to some points (baskets of goods) which are on the same indifference curve, and the further away from the origin, the higher the use value the indifference curve represents. Due to the human’s nature of self-interest, if there are not any constraints, the consumer will choose countless points on the indifference curve that is infinitely far from the origin. Obviously, such an answer is meaningless and does not help to infer the consumer’s behaviors.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-6\n\nNext we will introduce the “Budget Line” which is used to reflect the constraints faced by the consumer. The straight line through the points A, E and B in Fig.10-6 is the budget line, which is drawn according to the equation of PxX + PyY = I. The economic implication of the budget line is that the consumer is faced with two constraints: income and price (the relative price of X and Y). If there were no constraint of income, the consumer could buy whatever he wants, so he would not need to choose. With the restrictions of “self-interest” and that “more is preferred to less”, he could consume infinite quantities of both goods. Or even though his income is limited, but if the goods were free, the limited income would not be a constraint, and the consumer could also consume infinite quantities of both goods. Only when his income is limited and he must pay a price to buy the goods, need the consumer think about the following questions: how should I allocate my limited income to buy different goods for consumption, which is optimal to me? According to the analysis on preference in previous sections, the optimum of the consumer is to maximize the use value (utility), which is the implication of self-interest, under the constraints of income and price.\nLet's look at the geometric solution first. As shown in Fig.10-6, the budget line and the indifference curves are drawn in the same rectangular coordinate. There are three kinds of relationships between the indifference curves and the budget line: intersection (e.g. U1), tangency (e.g. U2) and separation (e.g. U3). Obviously, the indifference curve of U3 is the farthest from the origin among the three curves, representing the highest use value and is most preferred by the consumer. However, it is a pity that it is not attainable for the consumer, because it is separated from the budget line, the economic implication of which is that every point on it cannot be affordable by this consumer under the constraints of his income and the current relative price of good X and Y. Everyone wants to live in a luxury villa, enjoy the delicacies and expensive food every day, and take a cruise to travel around the world, which is precisely represented by the indifference curves separated from the budget line such as U3 that is too good to be affordable.\nFor the other two indifference curves, the arc from point A to point B of U1 represents the baskets of goods that is affordable by the consumer, but this curve is the nearest to the origin among the three ones, which means that the use value it represents is also the lowest, so the consumer is not interested in it. The rest is the indifference curve of U2, and there is only one point on it that is affordable by the consumer can afford, which is point tangent to the budget line. One point is enough, and it is exactly the optimum of the consumer, because it is the only basket of goods that is affordable by the consumer on the farthest indifference curve from the origin that is attainable for the consumer under the current constraints.\nThen let’s turn to the corresponding algebraic solution. Since the geometric solution is the tangent point of the indifference curve that is tangent to the budget line, the algebraic solution is to find where the slopes of them are equal. The budget line is a straight line with the equation of PxX + PyY = I ,so the slope of it is $\\frac{Px}{Py}$ , the relative price of the two goods. How about the slope of the indifference curve? According to calculus, the slope of a curve is the derivative of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, which is called the “marginal rate of substitution in consumption” (MRSc) in economics. The economic implication is that if the use values of the basket of these two goods keep unchanged, when the consumption of one good is increased, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of the other good, which means the substitution of the consumption of the other good with that of one good. Thus, $\\frac{Px}{Py} = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the algebraic solution to the optimum of the consumer.\nThe geometric and algebraic solutions mentioned above are both “interior solutions” in mathematics, but there are also “corner solutions”. In Fig.10-7, the indifference curve of U2 is tangent to the budget line in the negative domain, which obviously could not happen in reality. Therefore, the consumer can only choose U1 as the second best choice, because it is the farthest one from the origin (and the closest one to U2) among all the indifference curves that intersect the budget line in the positive domain. The intersection point of U1 and the budget line is the same intersection point of the budget line and the vertical axis, the economic implication of which is that this consumer will spend all his income on good Y, and does not buy any good X at all. In reality, there are a large number of goods that a consumer does not buy at all, such as luxury villas, global tourism which are too expensive, as well as the goods which are very cheap with extremely poor quality, and the goods which are of no use to himself (such as a novel written in Malagasy). They are all the examples of good X in this Figure. By the way, it is necessary to have a broad understanding of good X and Y. For example, X in the corner solution can be regarded as all the goods the consumer does not buy, while Y can be regarded as all the other goods he will buy more or less. Thus, it is not unrealistic for this model of two goods.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-7\n\nAttention: there is a constraint implied in the above analysis of the optimum of the consumer that there is no borrowing or lending in the world simulated by this model. In reality, people will not spend all their incomes now, which is usually not the optimum. They will choose between present consumption and future consumption, which will be analyzed by the interest theory in the later lecture. Now it is supposed that the present income must be spent completely at present, or else it will rot and lose its value in the future (imagine that this income is represented by fresh fruits and vegetables), so there will be no borrowing and lending in the word, which means you cannot lend the present income to others for his present consumption in exchange for his repayment to you in the future for your future consumption. And the current consumption cannot exceed the current income either, because you cannot borrow other’s present income for your present consumption.\n\nMathJax = {\n  tex: {\n    inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]\n  },\n  svg: {\n    fontCache: 'global'\n  }\n};\n\n\n"},"Lecture10/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Changes of the Optimum of the Consumer","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Changes of the Optimum of the Consumer\nIn the previous section, is has been explained how to find the optimum of the consumer: based on the two axioms about preference and the concept of utility (or use value), indifference curve is derived, the contingent point of which and the budget line reflecting the two main constraints of income and price determines the optimum of the consumer or the so-called consumption equilibrium. If the constraints change, the optimum or equilibrium will change too. This will be explained in this section.\nSince the budget line reflects the two main constraints of income and price, the equilibrium changes caused by the changes in income and price are discussed separately below. Let’s look at the income change first. As shown in Fig.10-8, if income rises from I to I’ while prices are held constant, the budget line shifts outwards parallel to itself, from BL to B’L’. The new optimum position is at point E’, where the budget line L’ is tangent to the higher indifference curve U1. As can be seen from Fig.10-8, points E, E’, E’’ are equilibrium points when the income is I, I’, I’’ respectively. Connecting all these equilibrium points, a curve called “Income Expansion Path (IEP)” can be drawn. Each point on this curve is an equilibrium point, only reflecting different incomes.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-8\n\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-9\n\nThe shape of IEP can be that in Fig.10-8 or be that in Fig.10-9. For the IEP in Fig.10-8, when income increases, the consumption of both X and Y rises. However, for the IEP in Fig.10-9, when income increases, only the consumption of Y rises, while that of X falls. Both goods in Fig.10-8 and Y in Fig.10-9 are called superior goods, while X in Fig.10-9 is called inferior good. Caution: an inferior good is not a good of poor quality, but just refers to the good that the consumer will buy less when his income rises. For example, a bicycle may be a typical inferior good. One chooses to ride bicycle when his income is low, and change to car when his income rises, but his bicycle is not necessarily of poor quality. Now in many developed countries, when people's incomes are higher, they have become more environmentally friendly, and there is a tendency to return to bicycles. In this case, it is car that has become an inferior good!\nThe IEP shows how consumption baskets (combinations of goods) change as income rises or falls. The Engel Curve pictures the effect of income changes upon a single good X with the horizontal axis as income and the vertical axis as the quantity of X, such as Fig.10-10. The Engel curve is named after a German statistician Engel, because his research on the relationship between income and consumption is the most famous. Obviously, EC1 represents a superior good, while EC2 represents an inferior good.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-10\n\nNext, let’s look at the equilibrium change caused by the change in price. The slope of the budget line in Fig.10-11 represents the relative price of X and Y, so the change of it reflects the change in price, which will also cause the change of tangent point of the indifference curve. The points E, E’, E’’ in Fig.10-11 are equilibrium points with different prices. Connecting all of them, a curve called “Price Expansion Path (PEP)” can be drawn. Each point on this curve is an equilibrium point, only reflecting different (relative) prices. In Fig.10-11, only the (absolute) price of X changes, so the intersection point of the budget lines and the vertical axis has not changed, and just the intersection points of them and the horizontal axis have changed. The PEP drawn under such constraint (the absolute price of Y remains unchanged) starts from point B, and it is impossible to be higher than the vertical magnitude of point B (the horizontal dashed line in Fig.10-11). However, in reality, the (absolute) price of X and Y can both change at the same time, and then the intersections of the budget lines and the both axis will all change.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-11\n\nDraw both the IEP and PEP in a same coordinate system, and have a good understanding of this statement: every point in this coordinate plane must be on a certain IEP or PEP, which means that it is equilibrium. As a result, those who are used to thinking in mathematics (geometry) may be able to understand what is said in Lecture 7 that it is always equilibrium. If there is a case that seems to be disequilibrium, there must be some constraints that are neglected. Taking all the constraints into account, it is always equilibrium. Under different constraints, there are different equilibriums. As shown in Fig.10-8 and 10-11, point E’ is disequilibrium with respect to the budget line of BL’ (reflecting the constraint of a certain set of income and price), but it is equilibrium with respect to B’L’ in Fig.10-8 or BL’ in Fig.10-11 (reflecting the constraint of another set of income and price). If one thinks that the point E’ is disequilibrium, he only misunderstand the relevant constraint.\nThe PEP shows how consumption baskets (combinations of goods) change as price rises or falls. The demand curve pictures the effect of price changes upon a single good X with the horizontal axis as the quantity of X and the vertical axis as price, such as Fig.8-1 in Lecture 8. MSE comes up with such a complicated consumer theory just to deduce the law of demand law as a theorem instead of an axiom.\n"},"Lecture10/Section06.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section06.html","title":"Section 6: Are there Giffen Goods?","keywords":"","body":"Section 6: Are there Giffen Goods?\nJust as for the Engel curve derived from IEP, when income rises, the quantity of good X will rise (superior good) or fall (inferior good); for the demand curve derived from PEP, when price rises, the quantity of good X will fall or rise. However, the latter is not in line with the law of demand!\nFig.10-12 illustrates how such a case that is not in line with the law of demand happen geometrically. Here is the economic implication. There are actually two kinds of effects for a price change: one is substitution effect, the other is income effect.\nSubstitution effect means when the price of a good rises, people will change to consume its substitutes. Under the constraint of constant income, all goods are substitutes, because if one wants to buy more of one good, he has to buy less of the other good to free up income.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-6[^1]\n\nIncome effect means when the price of a good rises, people’s real income falls with other factors unchanged, which will cause people increase or decrease the consumption of the good. Suppose one’s income is RMB1000, and the price of a bottle of water is originally RMB1. If he spends all his income on water, he can buy 1000 bottles of water. Then the price of a bottle of water rises to RMB2, he can only buy 500 bottles of water now, which is the same as if the price of a bottle water keeps RMB1 while his income falls to RMB500. Therefore, a rise in the price is similar to a fall in income. The purchasing power of monetary income is called real income in economics. For example, when the price of a bottle of water is RMB1, the real income of RMB1000 is 1000 bottles of water. So when the price of a bottle of water is RMB2, the real income of RMB1000 falls to 500 bottles of water. Thus, changes in the price of a good will cause changes in real income.\nThe substitution effect is based on the premise that “real income remains unchanged”, then it can be separated from the income effect, and it is easy to understand why there would be cases that are not in line with the law of demand. The price and quantity in the substitution effect must change in the opposite direction, which is determined by the postulate of self-interest. However, the price and quantity in the income effect do not necessarily change in the same direction. In the case of inferior goods, they change in the opposite direction. Thus, when the price of inferior goods rises, the substitution effect leads to a decrease in quantity. However, a rise in the price is equivalent to a fall in real income which causes the consumption of inferior goods to fall. As long as the income effect exceeds the substitution effect, there will be a rise in the net change of quantity.\nThis kind of goods that is not in line with the law of demand is called “Giffen Goods”, because it is a British knight named Giffen who firstly proposed this possibility to Marshall when he revised his “Principles of Economics”. Marshall wrote it down in his book and named it after him. In fact, Giffen had never seen such Giffen goods with his own eyes, but just proposed such a possibility in logic, and gave an imaginary example of Irish peasants’ potatoes. Irish peasants were so poor that their income came mainly from the sale of potatoes and they also mainly fed on potatoes and a little meat. If there were a serious crop failure of potato in a year, the price of potato would rise dramatically, but the income of Irish peasants would drop dramatically. Although the price of potato rose, the production quantity of potato fell even more, so the income still dropped. These poor peasants could not afford even a little meat which was substituted by more potatoes, so the price of potato rose and it seemed to be not in line with the law of demand.\nThis imaginary example of Irish peasants’ potatoes proposed by Giffen has mistakenly become a fact that he had really seen. The following reading material “Was Bread a Giffen Good?” is about the investigation by the economic historian to see if the bread of English rural laborer household which is similar to the potatoes of Irish peasants was a Giffen good. The result of it shows that bread was not a Giffen good. In fact, No economist has found any Giffen goods in reality so far.\n\nREADING MATERIAL: WAS BREAD A GIFFEN GOOD?2\nSome historians have suggested that bread was a Giffen good for English rural laborers at the end of the eighteenth century.\nA study by Roger Koenker casts doubt on this claim. 3 In the late eighteenth century, the limited transportation network in Britain meant that prices differed considerably across communities. These differences, as well as changes over time, provided data for estimating the demand for bread.\nThe demand function of a typical English rural laborer household was estimated as follows:\nQuantity of bread = 0.40 + 0.41 Family size + 0.024 Weekly expenditures−0.35 Bread price + 0.57 Meat price\nHere bread quantity was measured in loaves per week, bread price in pence per loaf, and meat price in pence per pound. Weekly spending (in pence per week) was used as the measure of overall income.\nThe negative coefficient (−0.35) for bread price shows that bread was not a Giffen good for these consumers. Indeed, the positive coefficient for weekly spending (income) suggests that both bread and meat were normal superior goods. (As the text showed, although an inferior good can be a Giffen good, a superior good cannot be.) The positive coefficient on the meat price means that an increase in the price of meat increased consumption of bread, suggesting that bread and meat were substitutes. Consumers, buying less meat in response to the higher meat price, bought more bread.\n\nAs mentioned in Lecture 8, there was a debate in China about whether the law of demand had been refuted. At that time, a large number of people claimed to have seen Giffen goods which were not at all if closely examined. As can be seen from the above discussion, Giffen goods are strictly defined in economics. The goods with the consumption that appears to rise along with the rise in price are not defined as Giffen goods. They must be inferior goods firstly, and then the income effect must exceed the substitution effect. The higher the tuition (price) of an MBA degree is, the more people apply for it. The more expensive the luxury is, the more consumers buy it. The higher the stock price is, the more investors buy in ... These phenomena seem to refute the law of demand, but they cannot be regarded as Giffen cases. How likely are MBA degree, luxury, stock ... to be inferior goods which means people will consume less of them when they become richer? They cannot even satisfy the first requirement (inferior goods) of Giffen goods.\nHowever, despite the above ignorant arguments, there are still following questions in economics: are there Giffen goods in reality? Has the law of demand been refuted by Giffen goods? There are three levels of answers to these questions.\nThe first level of answer: from the perspective of mathematics (geometry), there do logically be Giffen goods. Therefore, the law of demand cannot be deduced from consumer theory, unless it is supplemented with the supposition that there are no Giffen goods.\nThe second level of answer: from the perspective of reality, there cannot be Giffen goods. The reason is very simple. Although there are inferior goods in reality, it is almost impossible for the income effect to exceed the substitution effect. One needs to consume thousands of goods, so the expenditure of one good accounted for the proportion of his total income cannot be very high, and the income effect caused by the rise in the price of it is negligible, basically cannot exceed the substitution effect. Even for high-priced commodities such as real estate, they are bought through long-term savings at one time, so the price is actually not so high if decomposed into the proportion of the income in each month, which is much easier to understand when houses are commonly paid by installment nowadays. What is more, houses are seldom inferior goods, let alone Giffen goods.\nOf course, it can be imagined that the extreme case such as the Irish peasants’ potatoes proposed by Giffen would really happen in reality. The income effect of the price change in potato would be strong enough to overwhelm the substitution effect. However, as long as Irish peasants’ income rose slightly, it were impossible to spend most of the income on one good. Moreover, the consumption of inferior goods would fall rapidly with the rise of income, so the impact of the income effect would also fall rapidly. Thus, there would be Giffen goods under so extreme circumstances that could only be imagined.\nThe third level of answer: from the perspective of market transactions in a society, there is impossible to be Giffen goods. If one would really buys more of a good when it is more expensive (the good is his Giffen good), others would raise the price of it to infinity and sell it to him. He would spend all his wealth on this good, and never sell it out again. In other words, Giffen goods will be eliminated out of the market by competition.\nIn conclusion, there are no Giffen goods in reality. Even there are, they are not important, and does not need to be cared about in economics. If it were not for MSE to deduce the law of demand with the more complicated consumer theory, but simply regard the law of demand as an axiom that needs no proof and only be accepted, the problem of Giffen goods would not be a problem at all!\n\n\n1. The consumption change from point P to C can be decomposed into the move from point P to S which is called substitution effect and the mover from point S to C which is called income effect. The former is called substitution effect because both points of P and S are on the same indifference curve, which reflects that income is constant, so there is no income effect. The substitution effect causes the consumption to rise from X1 to X2. The left panel is about the case of superior goods where the positive income effect causes the consumption to rise further from X2 to X3. In contrast, the right panel is about the case of inferior goods where the negative income effect causes the consumption to fall from X2 to X3, and it even exceeds the substitution effect, which causes X3 to be less than X1. ↩\n\n\n2.

If it is the market demand curve of a Public Good, it should be obtained by summing the individual demand curve vertically. The characteristics of public goods are non-exclusive and non-competitive in consumption, which means the same public good can be consumed by more than one person without interfering with each other.1 For example, if one eats an apple, others are not able to eat it again, so apple is a “private good”. By contrast, if one is listening to a song, others can also listen to it, so song is a “public good”. Because the consumption of a public good is non-exclusive, the total demand of it cannot be obtained by summing all the individuals’ demands, but the total income of it can be obtained by summing the prices paid by all individuals. For example, a song can be supplied to countless audiences, and the producer does not need to increase the quantities as more and more listen to it. By contrast, the producer of apple needs to increase the quantities supplied as more and more want to buy. Therefore, the income from this song is summation of the prices paid by all the audiences. That is why the market demand curve for public goods is obtained by summing the individual demand curves vertically, which means summation of the prices, instead of horizontally, which means summation of the quantities.\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-13\n\nThe non-exclusive consumption of public goods not only affects the market demand curve, but also makes it more difficult to protect the PPRs of public goods than private goods, which will be explained in detail later in this book.\n\n\n1.

Public goods can be owned and supplied by private individual. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture10/Section08.html":{"url":"Lecture10/Section08.html","title":"Section 8: Is There Theory of Elasticity?","keywords":"","body":"Section 8: Is There Theory of Elasticity?\n\n  \n\nFigure 10-14\n\nThe law of demand only tells us that the demand curve has negative slope. As shown in Fig.10-14, both D1 and D2 are demand curves with different negative slopes, but the rises in quantity demanded caused by the same fall in price from P to P’ are quite different for these two demand curves. Obviously, the rise in quantity demanded for D1 with flatter negative slope is much more than that for D2 with steeper negative slope. In reality, a slight change in the price of some goods does cause a larger change in quantity, while a large change in the price of other goods just causes a little change in quantity. In other words, there are different sensitivities to price changes for different shapes of demand curves, which are measured by “Elasticity” in economics.\nThe concept of elasticity in economics is again copied from physics. Elasticity in physics refers to the sensitivity of deformation of an object to changes in force. For example, if a spring will stretch a lot when pulled lightly, it is elastic. By contrast, if a spring will only stretch a little when pulled hard, it is inelastic. Human’s skin is another typical example. It is very elastic because it will cave in when pressed lightly with a finger. By contrast, the surface of a table seems not change at all when pressed hard with a finger, unless it is watched carefully with a microscope, so the table is very inelastic.\nIt is Marshall again who copied the concept of elasticity from physics to economics, because the extent of quantity changes caused by price changes is equivalent to that of the deformation of an object caused by force. Elasticity coefficient is also used to measure elasticity, such as \n$$η≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP}}{\\frac{Q}{P}} ≡ \\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP} \\frac{P}{Q}$$.\n $$\\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\\frac{ΔP}{P}}$$\n  is the definition formula of the price elasticity coefficient of demand. The numerator of it is the proportionate change in quantity purchased (i.e. the changing value divided by the initial value in quantity), while the denominator of it is the proportionate change in price (i.e. the change value of price divided by the initial value of price). This formula of elasticity measures a good’s sensitivity to changes in price. The reason why an elasticity measure defined in terms of proportionate changes is used is to avoid the difficulty of being affected by the units of measurement. For example, if the direct measure of $\\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP}$ is used, how to compare the price elasticity of cars in China and that of planes in US when there are different weight units and different currencies. However, the effects of different units can be eliminated by using proportionate changes, so the elasticity of any good in any currency can be directly compared.\nBecause the demand curve has negative slope, the price elasticity of demand must be negative. There are three kinds of elasticity based on the relationship between its absolute value and unity. If the elasticity measure exceeds unity in absolute value, a demand curve is said to be “elastic”, which means the proportionate change in quantity is more than that in price. And the demand is said to be “inelastic” if the elasticity has an absolute value less than unity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is less than that in price. If the elasticity has an absolute value equivalent to unity, it is called “unitary” elasticity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is the same as that in price.\nIn addition, strictly speaking, the above formula of elasticity coefficient is used to calculate the arc elasticity. As the intervals and shrink toward zero, the arc elasticity approaches the point elasticity, and the formula of elasticity coefficient becomes $\\frac{dQ}{dP}∙\\frac{P}{Q}$. The left part of this formula is the reciprocal of the slope of the demand curve, which shows that the elasticity and the slope of the demand curve are not the same. If the demand curve is a straight line, the slope on each point is the same, but the elasticity varies along the curve. So it is rarely advisable to describe an entire demand curve as elastic (or inelastic). Rather, one should say that demand is elastic (or inelastic) in the neighborhood of some given price-quantity point. However, at the same price level, the elasticity of demand curves with different slopes can be compared. As can be seen from the Fig.10-14, the flatter the demand curve is, the more elastic it is. On the contrary, the steeper the demand curve is, the more inelastic it is.\nWhy should we care about elasticity? Because if a good is elastic or inelastic will affect the pricing strategy of the producer. If a good is elastic, when the producer only slightly raises the price, the quantity will drop sharply. However, when the producer slightly decreases the price, the quantity will greatly rise. Because the revenue from the sale is the price multiplied by the quantity, it is better for the producer to adopt the strategy of cutting the price to promote the sales, which can bring about an increase in revenue.\nBy contrast, if a good is inelastic, when the producer raises the price substantially, the quantity will not drop much. However, when the producer decreases the price substantially, the quantity will not increase much. For the inelastic good, the strategy of price cutting will only decrease the revenue. There is a Chinese saying that “Low prices for grain hurt the peasants”. The substantial rise in grain output during the harvest year will cause the price to drop sharply, but the consumptions will not increase much, thus causing the revenues of the peasants to fall instead of rise.\nThe concept of elasticity extends to many other fields. For example, from the supplements and substitutes discussed before, it can be seen that the price change in a good will not only affect the demand of itself, but also the demand for its supplements and substitutes. If the denominator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in price of a good) is changed to the proportionate change in price of another good, it is called the cross-elasticity of demand: \n$$η_{xy} ≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ_x}{Q_x}}{\\frac{ΔP_y}{P_y}} ≡\\frac{ΔQ_x}{ΔP_y } \\frac{P_y}{Q_x}$$\nUnlike the price elasticity of demand which is always negative, the cross-elasticity of demand can be positive or negative. If good X is the substitute of good Y, the quantity of X will rise along with the rise in the price of Y, so the cross-elasticity of a substitute is positive. By contrast, if good X is the supplement of good Y, the quantity of X will fall along with the rise in the price of Y, so the cross-elasticity of a supplement is negative.\nIf the denominator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in price of a good) is changed to the proportionate change in income, it is called the income elasticity of demand: \n$$ɛ≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\\frac{ΔI}{I}} ≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{ΔI }}{\\frac{Q}{I}} ≡ \\frac{ΔQ}{ΔI}\\frac{I}{Q}$$\n If the good is a superior good, the quantity of it will rise along with the rise in income, so the income elasticity of a superior good is positive. By contrast, if the good is an inferior good, the quantity of it will fall along with the rise in income, so the income elasticity of an inferior good is negative.\nIf the numerator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in quantity purchased) is changed to the proportionate change in quantity sold, it is called the price elasticity of supply: \n$$κ≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP} \\frac{P}{Q}$$\n, which seems the same as the formula for the price elasticity of demand \n($$η≡ \\frac{\\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP } \\frac{P}{Q}$$)\n, but the Q in η means quantity purchased that is related to quantity demanded, while Q in κ means quantity sold that is related to quantity supplied. Since the supply curve is sloping upwards, the price elasticity of supply is always positive. There are also three kinds of price elasticity of supply based on the relationship between its value and unity. If the elasticity measure exceeds unity, a supply curve is said to be “elastic”, which means the proportionate change in quantity is more than that in price. And the supply is said to be “inelastic” if the elasticity has a value less than unity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is less than that in price. If the elasticity has a value equivalent to unity, it is called “unitary” elasticity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is the same as that in price.\nIn fact, one can put any different data into the numerator and denominator of the elasticity coefficient formula to create various kinds of elasticity. For example, in international finance, if one wants to study how much the devaluation or appreciation of a country’s currency affects the change in import or export volume, he can put the proportionate change in the value of currency value in the denominator, and the proportionate change in import or export volume in the numerator to calculate the monetary elasticity of import or export. Thus, there can be various kinds of elasticity in economics. Since the price elasticity of demand is the first elasticity, it is the default of elasticity if there is no specific statement.\nHowever, elasticity is not really very useful in explaining phenomena or economic decisions, because so far economists have not found a reliable rule (theory) to determine how much the elasticity is in advance. If we cannot tell whether a good is elastic or inelastic until we observe the quantity drops significantly or slightly, we have not really used elasticity to explain the phenomena. The elasticity is again just a tautology, because it is always true ex post. The real explanation should be prediction ex ante. A useful theory of elasticity must be able to provide some clear principles, according to which one can know what are the constraints determining whether a good is elastic or inelastic, and then examine the reality to predict in advance whether the good analyzed is elastic or inelastic.\nIt is generally believed in MSE that there are three kinds of determinants (constraints) that affect the price elasticity of demand.\n(1) Availability of substitutes: Demand for a good will be more elastic the more numerous and the closer the available substitutes.\n(2) Luxuries versus necessities: Demand for a “luxury” tends to be more elastic than demand for a “necessity”.\n(3) High-priced versus low-priced goods: Along a linear demand curve, elasticity is higher at higher prices.\nHowever, unfortunately, all these three constraints are not binding, and meaningless in inference of the elasticity. For example, the first constraint about the availability of substitutes means how many there are substitutes and how strong the substitutability is. As mentioned in the section about substitutes in Lecture 8, any two seemingly unrelated commodities can become substitutes under specific constraints. There is a real example in marketing: the game makers found that a chocolate popular in middle school students had become a competitor or substitute for their products. The pocket money of middle school students was basically a fixed amount, so when they bought more chocolate, they had to cut their spending on other goods including games.\nThe second constraint about the division between luxuries and necessities, but is it really so easy to distinguish luxuries and necessities? For a businessman, luxuries are actually necessities. He needs the luxuries (such as BMW) as a signal to convey the information that he is doing well in business, earning high income, and therefore is very capable. Thus here is again the problem: under specific constraints, any seemingly luxuries can become necessities.\nAs for the third constraint, the boundary of high-priced goods and low-priced goods is even more ambiguous. There is no absolute high price or absolute low price, which again depends on specific constraints.\nA. A. Alchian (1914-2013) proposed a much clearer constraints than the above three constraints: time. With the passage of time, the information cost about substitutes for a good will decrease. As a result, the number of substitutes will increase, and the good changes from inelastic to elastic. Alchian called it “the second law of demand.”\nHowever, Steven N. S. Cheung, his student, found that the fact of the undersea tunnel in Hong Kong had refuted this second law of demand. Every time the toll of the undersea tunnel in Hong Kong is increased, the traffic will always fall significantly at first, and then gradually rise to the previous level. It seems that the undersea tunnel changes from elastic to inelastic, which is precisely contrary to the prediction of the second law of demand. The reason is quite simple. As soon as the toll of undersea tunnel is increased, people turn to other transportation means (such as ferries). But after a period of time they will find that all other transportation means are far less convenient than the undersea tunnel, so they turn back to it gradually.\nIn other words, with the passage of time, the information cost about substitutes does decrease, but it does not logically always result in the rise in the number of substitutes for a good. It is also possible that people find there are no substitutes good enough when they are better informed. Thus, the number of substitutes for the good actually drops rather than rises.\nIn conclusion, until now there has not been a theory of elasticity that can tell a good is elastic or inelastic in advance by determining the relevant constraints. There has been a concept of elasticity which is useless in explaining or predicting phenomena.\n\nMathJax = {\n  tex: {\n    inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]\n\n  },\n  svg: {\n    fontCache: 'global'\n  }\n};\n\n\n"},"Lecture11/":{"url":"Lecture11/","title":"Lecture 11: The Concept of Cost","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 11: The Concept of Cost\nFrom this lecture on, we will turn from consumer theory to theory of firm. As mentioned in Lecture 10, consumer theory of MSE is useless in explaining phenomenon, while there are full of serious mistakes in the theory of firm which will be discussed from this lecture on.\nIn many microeconomics textbooks nowadays, the issue about “the cause of firm” is included in the theory of firm. However, the cause of firm does not belong to the traditional theory of firm at all, but to the firm theory. “Theory of Firm” and “Firm Theory” does look very similar, but they are in fact rather different. Theory of firm studies the production process that how many inputs will produce how many outputs, focusing on the technical characteristics of production, and belongs to microeconomics (price theory). By contrast, firm theory studies the organizational form or contractual arrangement for production, focusing on the contractual or institutional characteristics of production, and belongs to new institutional economics.\nIn theory, production does not need to be carried out through firms. A street vendor or a store runner is an individual, not a firm. He also engages in the activities of supplying goods in the market. Of course, in modern society, a lot of production is carried out through firms rather than individuals, because it is more advantageous to organize individuals in cooperative production in the form of firms. However, the traditional theory of firm does not care about this phenomenon, and does not ask what makes firm as an organizational form more advantageous than the self-employed individual. It only studies how many production factors a producer (no matter he is an individual or a firm) inputs and then how many outputs he can get technically, and presents this technical feature mathematically with production function. Production function is just an equation reflecting the technical characteristics of production, so it is essentially not economics at all, but engineering. In reality, if different organizational forms or institutions are used along with the same technology, the same inputs will produce different outputs. It is precisely the problem that economics should study, because it cannot be answered by engineering.\nThe traditional theory of firm is essentially an engineering theory, not an economic theory. A theory studying production that truly belongs to economics cannot ignore the organizational form, contractual arrangement or institutional conditions of production, which is bound to fall within the scope of new institutional economics. In other words, the constraint of transaction cost must be considered and included in such a real economic theory.\nHowever, in this and the following two lectures, we will first introduce the “pure” theory of firm that does not need to consider the constraint of transaction cost. It does not mean that there is no transaction cost in production, but that under specific circumstances, transaction cost is are not the key constraint that determines the change in production and can be classified as “the other factors unchanged”. Later in this book, the concept of transaction cost will introduced in detail, and then it will be also discussed in detail as a key constraint that determines the organizational form, contractual arrangement or institutional conditions of production. Only at that time can we analyze the cause of firm.\n"},"Lecture11/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture11/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Opportunity Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Opportunity Cost\nIn this lecture, we will introduce one of the most important concepts in economics: cost.\nPlease think about the following questions: What is the cost of a student going to university?  Firstly, he has to pay tuition. Anything else? Yes! In addition to tuition, he also has to give up the income from working.\nThe cost in economics or economic cost is different from that used in daily life which refers to accounting cost, historical cost or monetary expenditure. However, the economic cost refers to the highest income given up. That is why it is called “opportunity cost” which means that cost is the highest income among the opportunities given up.\nNext, a numerical example will be used to illustrate the concept of opportunity cost. As shown in table 11-1 below, suppose there are two options A and B, and the income of option A is 100, while the income of option B is 200. What are the costs of these two options respectively? According to the concept of opportunity cost introduced above, the cost of A is the income of B which is 200, while the cost of B is the income of A which is 100.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\n200\n\n\nB\n200\n100\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-1\n\n\nSuppose there is more option C with the income of 300 as shown in Table 11-2. What are the costs of A, B and C? If one chooses A, he gives up B and C, but which has the highest income? It is C, so the income of C instead of B is the cost, and the cost of A is 300. Similarly, the cost of B is also the income of C which is 300. What about the cost of C? If one chooses C by giving up A and B, the income of B is the highest among A and B, so the cost of C is 200.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\n300\n\n\nB\n200\n300\n\n\nC\n300\n200\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-2\n\n\nIt is clear that the highest income given up is the cost. As long as the highest income remains unchanged, the cost will also remain unchanged no matter how the incomes of other options (including the income of the option chosen) change.\nCaution: The cost of C is not the sum of the incomes of A and B, but the one with higher income. However, if one option can only be chosen by giving up multiple options, the incomes of them must be summed up. For example, what is the cost for a student to go to university? On the one hand, he has given up some money for paying tuition. Attention: tuition is cost, not because the student has spent money, but because he has given up the option of using the money to buy other goods. In other words, he has given up the use value of consuming other goods, and it is also a kind of non-monetary income which is the cost of going to university. Cost must be seen from the perspective of giving up income, not from the perspective of expenditure, otherwise it will be confused with the concept of accounting cost or historical cost. On the other hand, the student has also given up the income of working. The student must give up these two options at the same time to go to university, so both incomes must be summed up. It is different from the numerical example in Table 11.2 where if A is chosen, B cannot be chosen, so only the higher income of B is the cost of C.\nOne does not need study economics to know that he should choose the option with the least cost. However, one needs to study economics to know that he should not choose according to (accounting) cost in daily life, but according to opportunity cost. For example, why are there more customers going to barbershop on weekends than on weekdays. The price of haircut is the same on weekdays as on weekends. If one chooses when to have a haircut according to the cost or expenditure in daily life, weekdays should be the same as weekends. The answer is: because people choose when to have a haircut according to the opportunity cost. If one goes to barbershop on weekdays, he not only gives up the money paying for the haircut, but also the income of working. By contrast, if he goes to barbershop on weekends, he does not need to give up the income of working. Therefore, the opportunity cost of haircut on weekends is actually lower than on weekdays. It is the law of demand that determines more people will choose to go to barbershop on weekends with lower cost! What is more, it is opportunity cost instead of only the price paid for a haircut that is the variable of price in the demand curve.\n"},"Lecture11/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture11/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Historical Cost is not Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Historical Cost is not Cost\nThere are some key points for opportunity cost.\nFirstly, there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Because cost is the highest income of the option that has been given up, if there is no alternative option, there will be no income that has been given up and no cost at all.\nSecondly, historical cost is not cost. The historical cost is the expenditure that has already been paid and has become history. Why is it not cost? The reason lies in the first key point above: there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Without time machine, human had not the option of go backing to the past to choose once again. Therefore, the expenditure that has already paid is like the water that has poured out, and it cannot affect the current choice.1\nIt is very important that historical cost is not cost, especially when making decisions in investment. Those who do not know or forget this key point will make mistakes. Suppose one has bought a stock at the price level of RMB100, and now the price falls to RMB80, should he sell the stock? He should not consider that historical cost of RMB100, but just consider whether the stock is expected to fall or rise in the future. If he expects the price of the stock will continue to fall, for example, to RMB50, the income and cost of his options is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA：Sell out\n80\n50\n\n\nB：Not sell\n50\n80\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-3\n\n\nNext, a real example will be used to illustrate how to apply the concept of opportunity cost: SARS!\nIn the spring of 2003, SARS broke out in China. This disease spread by close droplets transmission, so wearing masks is considered to be the most effective preventive measure. As a result, the public rushed to buy mask. The price of mask soared, causing public criticism. The stores of mask sellers were believed to have been bought in before the outbreak of SARS, and the prices then were very low. The sellers who raised the price of mask were criticized as looting a burning house and even making a fortune on nation’s trouble, and government was appealed to crack down on this so-called illegal price behavior.\nThree economic questions can be made out on the price rise of mask during SARS:\n(1) Even the price of mask has soared, but the demand for mask still dramatically increased. Has it refuted the law of demand?\n(2) Suppose the price of mask before SARS was RMB1, and rose to RMB10 during SARS. Why did it happen? In other words, why did the suppliers sell out the masks at RMB10 instead of the stock price of RMB1? Cautious: do not ask whether mask suppliers are bad guys or whether they should raise the price of mask or not? It is economic question, not moral criticism.\n(3) What would happen if government, influenced by public opinion, imposed price control prohibiting mask suppliers from raising the price?\nOnly the Question (2) will be explained here.\nThe masks bought before SARS were purchased at the price of RMB1 which was historical cost, not opportunity cost. What is the opportunity cost of the masks during SARS? Just with a look at the market of mask, anyone could see even if the price was raised to RMB10, the masks would be still sold out. Therefore, the options faced by a mask supplier were as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA：1RMB\n1\n10\n\n\nB：10RMB\n10\n1\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-4\n\n\nIf the mask supplier continued to sell at the price of RMB1 as before SARS, his mask could be all sold out, and his income per mask would be RMB1. If he raised the price to RMB10, his mask could still be sold out due to the huge demand in the market during SARS, and his income per mask would be RMB10. According to the concept of opportunity cost, the cost of A is the income of B which is RMB10, while the cost of B cost is the income of A which is RMB1. It is easy to predict that the self-interested suppliers would choose B for cost minimization. Attention: In the absence of SARS, mask suppliers could not sell out the masks at RMB10, because there would not be so huge demand for the mask or there was so high use value of mask in preventing the transmission of SARS. Without SARS, the income of B is only 0, not 10, so the cost of A is also 0, and the self-interested suppliers will choose A instead of B for cost minimization.\nIt is obvious that opportunity cost can well explain the mask suppliers’ behaviors no matter with SARS or without SARS. Especially during SARS, why would the mask suppliers set the price different from the purchase cost (historical cost) could not be explained by historical cost, but well explained by opportunity cost. In other words, the rise in price of mask during SARS has also proved eloquently that it is not the historical cost but the opportunity cost that determines human’s behavior. It is precisely why in economics the concept of opportunity cost must take the place of the accounting cost or historical cost commonly used in daily life. It is not because economists like to be different, but because historical cost cannot explain the phenomena in reality, while opportunity cost can.\n\n\n1. Some economics textbooks will also introduce a concept called “Sunk Cost” and carefully distinguish it from historical cost. However, they are in fact the same, and neither is (opportunity) cost. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture11/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture11/Section03.html","title":"Section3: The Disturbance of Historical Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section3: The Disturbance of Historical Cost\nSome may ask: since historical cost does not affect human’s choices, why is the concept of cost commonly used in daily life historical cost? Because under the constraint of information cost, there is still function of historical cost that human often use historical cost to estimate opportunity cost. As mentioned earlier, opportunity cost is not the actual expenditure, but the highest income given up. Since opportunity cost is the highest income given up, it is difficult to know exactly what the income is for the option that has not been chosen. Therefore opportunity cost is not easy to estimate, unlike historical cost which is what has happened and the value of it is fixed. In other words, generally the information cost of opportunity cost is higher than that of historical cost, so human tend to estimate opportunity cost based on historical cost, which is based on the assumption that the constraints that determined what had happened in the past will continue to determine what will happen in the future. As mentioned in Lecture 8, there is a school called “technical analysis” in the stock market that uses the path of the stock prices in the past to guess that in the future, which is precisely because the information cost for predicting the stock price is too high. It is the same as the explanation for human using historical cost to estimate opportunity cost. Just as it is wrong for the school of technical analysis” to assume that what had happened in the past will continue to happen in the future, it is also wrong to estimate the opportunity cost by historical cost. Human are not unaware of the problem with this assumption, but under the constraint of the high information cost, they can only choose to inaccurately estimate opportunity cost based on such a problematic assumption. As has been mentioned in Lecture 3, human are rational, which does not mean that they will not make wrong choices.\nSteven. N. S. Cheung has given a real example of selling used camera lens, which can well illustrate how people are misled by historical cost and mistakenly estimate opportunity cost under the constraint of information cost. Cheung intended to sell a used camera lens in the United States in 1970s. He had bought the lens for 500 dollar a few years ago, and he thought the depreciation of it should be 200 dollar, so he offered it for 300 dollar in the newspaper. There were so many buyers competing to buy it that it was sold out for 400 dollar finally. Only later did he know that the new product of the lens was selling for more than 1,000 dollar in the market. He sold it too cheaply.\nThe purchase price of 500 dollar after deducting depreciation is 300 dollar, which is historical cost. The opportunity cost of the used camera lens should be the current price of new product after deducting depreciation, which is more than 800 dollar. Cheung made a wrong choice because he did not know the information of the current price of new product. Of course, he could investigate the current price of the new product before selling the used lens, and then he would not be misled by historical cost, which would take time and effort that is precisely information cost. Generally speaking, due to the technical depreciation caused by technological progress, even if there is no physical depreciation caused by the use, the price of a good usually tends to drop over time. However, the constraint of technological progress is not always the key one that determines the price; otherwise there would be no antiques which are the older the more valuable. If one saves the information cost by not investigating the current price, he will take the risk that the constraint of technological progress may not be the key one that determines the price. In the later lecture of “Information Cost”, it will be pointed out that risk can be measured by information cost. If there are risks, it actually means that there are information costs. When one saves the information cost of investigation, he has to take the risk of making wrong decision which is also another kind of information cost. When Cheung sold his used camera lens, he must have thought the information cost of the latter was lower, so he chose to take the risk.\nHis choice can be simulated by the table 11-5. Suppose there is not depreciation of the used camera lens for simplicity, there are two options: A is to investigate the current price, and B is to estimate the price directly based on the historical cost of 500 dollar. For option A, before the investigation, he estimated that there would be 1% of possibility that the lens had appreciated over the years, while there would be 99% of possibility that the price had not changed. And it would take time and effort to investigate the current price, which was assumed to be equivalent to 10 dollar for him. Thus, the income of option A is 1000×1%＋500×99%－10＝495 dollar. For option B, there was no cost in investigating the current price, so the income is simply 500 dollar. Those who would minimize cost naturally chose B under such constraint. Attention: the market price of 1000 dollar known afterwards could not be regarded as the income of option A, because it was not known at the time of making decision. If it were known, there would be no risk or information cost about knowing the current price, and there would be no need to calculate the income of A with probability or mathematical expectation.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA：Investigate the current price\n495\n500\n\n\nB：Estimate by historical cost\n500\n495\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-5\n\n\nOf course, if the second-hand commodity is something with high possibility of appreciation (such as antiques), the probability in the mathematical expectation will need to be adjusted, and option A is entirely possible to be the optimum with lower cost. Suppose the possibility a good appreciating to 1000 dollar is 50% instead of 1%, so the possibility of that the price of 500 dollar has not changed is 50%. Thus the income of investigating the current price becomes 1000×50%＋500×50%－10＝740 dollar, as shown in the table 11-6.\nObviously, under the above constraint, people will definitely choose to investigate the current price, even if it takes time and energy for the investigation which is equivalent to 10 dollar, and will not be satisfied with estimating the price based on historical cost.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\n\n\n\n\nA：Investigate the current price\n740\n500\n\n\nB：Estimate by historical cost\n500\n740\n\n\n\n\nTable 11-6\n\n\nIn brief, as long as the information cost is low enough compared to the incremental income brought by the investigation, people will not choose to estimate opportunity cost with historical cost. And then it is clear that the essence of choice is based on opportunity cost rather than historical cost.\nLooking back on the example of the masks during SARS: When SARS broke out, there were so many reports from the media that masks could prevent the droplet transmission, that the mask suppliers could easily know that even if they raised the price to RMB10, they could sell out the masks, which means the information cost about the opportunity cost of masks had fallen to 0. No wonder the mask suppliers no longer estimated opportunity cost with historical cost as before, and chose to raise the price directly based on opportunity cost.\n"},"Lecture11/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture11/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Laboratory in Economics","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Laboratory in Economics\nFrom the discussion about opportunity cost and historical cost, readers should have a good understanding how to test an economic theory with facts. Under normal circumstances, it seems that suppliers’ pricing behaviors are based on historical cost, because they carefully record the historical cost of various commodities in accounting books. In fact, they only estimate opportunity cost by historical cost under the constraint of high information cost. However, how do economists know that suppliers’ pricing behaviors are actually based on opportunity costs rather than historical costs? Under normal circumstances, due to the high information cost, suppliers’ behaviors of using historical cost to estimate opportunity cost cause historical cost cannot be separated from opportunity cost. Therefore, economists have to find some very special circumstances where the constraint of information cost becomes insignificant, so suppliers do not need to estimate opportunity cost by historical cost. Only then can historical cost and opportunity cost be clearly separated, and it is clear that it is opportunity cost that actually determines human’s behaviors or decision-makings.\nIt is logically similar that before Galileo, it seemed that the heavier a body was, the faster it fell down, which meant the speed of a falling body was determined by constraint of its weight or mass. However, it is only because the air friction is an important constraint that affects the speed of the falling body in the environment of the earth. The air friction is related to the mass, or strictly speaking the density, of a body, so it interferes with the effect of gravity, which has seriously misled scientists for a long time.\nIn 1969, when man landed on the moon for the first time, the astronaut has done a physical experiment that he let go of an iron ball and a feather at the same height and at the same time on the surface of the moon. These two bodies were observed to land on the ground at the same time.  In such an environment as the moon close to vacuum, the air friction is reduced to basically 0, and it is successfully separated from the effect of gravity. And then it is clear that it is gravity rather than the weight or the mass of a body that actually determines the falling speed of a body.\nEconomics is a science, which is essentially the same as natural science like physics. There are many constraints that affect the research objects. Scientists must try to separate different constraints to study their effects. The advantage of natural science like physics is that it can artificially create an experimental environment that separates different constraints in the laboratory, while economics, as a social science, cannot do so. Although there is so-called “experimental economics”, this attempt to imitate natural science and conduct controlled experiments is fundamentally out of line with the nature of economics as a social science. The constraint in economics is social, not physical, and the nature of sociality will be lost if it is separated from the society in reality. However, economics has its own laboratory which is the reality. Economists do not need any controlled laboratory. What they need is to open their eyes and look for those special circumstances in reality which can meet the requirement of separating the different constraints. For example, SARS is such a special circumstance when the information cost of mask suppliers’ pricing could be reduced to 0, meeting the requirement of separating historical cost from opportunity cost.\nWhen Galileo discovered the law of free falling body, the physicists did not have much better experimental conditions than the economists nowadays. They had not the advanced technology that later sent the astronaut to the moon to drop an iron ball and a feather at the same time. Neither had they a laboratory to conduct experiments with vacuum environment. Galileo's experiment was to plane a piece of wood very smooth and set it up as all kinds of slopes with different leans, and let a ball roll down from the slope. He used this experiment to replace the experiment of free falling body, accurately calculating the relationship between distance and time, and making a decisive experimental conclusion.\nAs for economists, they should never expect to have a laboratory that can really stimulate the reality including all the key social constraints. They should try to know more about the reality, looking for the extreme cases that can meet the specific requirements.\nDo not worry there are too few such extreme cases. It seems that such cases as SARS are very rare to happen. However the cases when the information cost falls to zero, separating historical cost from opportunity cost do not just the masks during SARS. For example, antique is also such a case!\nAntique is a good that most typically implies that historical cost has no effect on pricing. The historical cost of a bowl made in the Tang Dynasty is negligible compared with the price of it in the market nowadays. Anyone will realize that historical cost has nothing to do with the price of an antique. There has been a long and difficult process for economists to understand opportunity cost. The classical economists, just like Aristotle in ancient Greece, were misled by the superficial phenomena to think that historical cost was the determinant of the value or price of a good, so the Theory of Labor Value was rather popular in classical period. There are two mistakes in this theory: one is that labor is regarded as the only source of the value of a good, and the other is that historical cost (the labor input during the production) is cost.\nThe former mistake will be discussed in the next lecture. Here the latter mistake will be discussed. Classical economists felt very confused with antiques, because they were obvious to refute the theory of labor value which thought that the value of a good should be determined by the labor input during the production. Ricardo had to divide all goods into two kinds: ordinary goods and antiques, arguing that the theory of labor value theory could apply to ordinary goods, while the value of antiques should be explained by another theory. However, Ricardo’s contraction the application of the theory of labor value could not save it from being refuted by such goods as the masks during SARS that are not antiques. What is more, the concept of opportunity cost can explain the pricing of all good, no matter they are antiques or the masks during SARS, so it has stronger explanatory power and more widely application than the theory of labor value which essentially explains the pricing of goods with historical cost. That is one of the reasons why the theory of labor value has been abandoned.\n"},"Lecture12/":{"url":"Lecture12/","title":"Lecture 12: The Concept of Rent","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 12: The Concept of Rent\n"},"Lecture12/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture12/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: From Income and Cost to Rent","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: From Income and Cost to Rent\nIn the previous lecture, when explaining the concept of cost, there was a numerical example which is shown here in Table 12-1 with an additional column of “rent” calculated by subtracting (opportunity) cost from income.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\n300\n-200\n\n\nB\n200\n300\n-100\n\n\nC\n300\n200\n100\n\n\n\n\nTable 12-1\n\n\nRent of the third column in Table 12-1 is often called “economic profit” by MSE and distinguished from accounting profit which is calculated by subtracting accounting cost from income, just as opportunity cost introduced in the previous lecture distinguished from accounting cost (historical cost). The concept of cost in economics must refer to opportunity cost, so the word “opportunity” need not be mentioned in economics. Similarly, the concept of profit in economics must refer to economic profit, so the word “economic” does not need to be mentioned in economics. However, it is not very accurate for MSE to use “profit” to refer to the difference between income and cost. It is much more accurate to use “rent”. And the term of “profit” should be used to refer to another concept different from rent or profit in MSE, which will be discussed in the last section of this lecture.\nRent of the third column in Table 12-1 is often called “economic profit” by MSE and distinguished from accounting profit which is calculated by subtracting accounting cost from income, just as opportunity cost introduced in the previous lecture distinguished from accounting cost (historical cost). The concept of cost in economics must refer to opportunity cost, so the word “opportunity” need not be mentioned in economics. Similarly, the concept of profit in economics must refer to economic profit, so the word “economic” does not need to be mentioned in economics. However, it is not very accurate for MSE to use “profit” to refer to the difference between income and cost. It is much more accurate to use “rent”. And the term of “profit” should be used to refer to another concept different from rent or profit in MSE, which will be discussed in the last section of this lecture.\nLook back at the numerical example in Table 12-1. Firstly, for the income of the first column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, C will be chosen because it is the option with highest income. Secondly, for the cost of the second column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, again C will be chosen because it is the option with least cost. Finally, for the rent of the third column, which option will be chosen? Obviously, C will be still chosen because it is the option with highest rent. In other words, income maximization, cost minimization and rent maximization are all the same.\nUnder different circumstances, sometimes the information about the income of various options is easily available, while sometimes it is the information about cost, or sometimes it is that about rent. Therefore, these three different angles can be respectively adopted according to specific circumstances. In addition, different economists may be good at analysis from different angles. For example, Ronald Harry Coase (1910-2013) is especially good at analysis from the perspective of cost, while Steven Cheung likes the perspective of rent. As will be explained in the later lecture on the “Interest Theory”, wealth is the sum of the discounted values of future income, so under a certain discount rate (interest rate), income maximization is same as wealth maximization. In other words, with interest taken into account, wealth maximization or income maximization is the most common angle to analyze different options for investment.\n"},"Lecture12/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture12/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The Changeable Rent","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The Changeable Rent\nRent is amazing in that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes even zero! \nTake the numerical example in previous section as an example again, but suppose the options are about how to use a piece of land, as the Table 12-2 shows.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Agricultural Land\n100\n300\n-200\n\n\nB：Industrial Land\n200\n300\n-100\n\n\nC：Residential Land\n300\n200\n100\n\n\n\n\nTable 12-2\n\n\nOption A is to use the land to grow crops, and the income is 100. And option B is to use the land to build factories, and the income is 200. And option C is to use the land to build houses, and the income is 300. The respective cost and rent of these three options are also the same as those in Table 12-1 of previous section.\nHowever, such division of options is rather rough. Option A is to use the land to grow crops, but what on earth is grown, wheat or rice? If it is rice, what is precisely the variety? Is fertilizer used? If yes, how much is used? Is one-harvest or two-harvest per year? In other words, there are actually countless sub-options in option A. It is the same for option B. Option B is to use the land to build a factory, but what kind of factory on earth is built? What is the plot ratio? Is it a bungalow or a building? How many floors? Is the factory of textiles, toys, steel, cars or software programs? It is the same for option C. Option C is to use the land to build a house, but what kind of house on earth is built? Is it a villa or an apartment? What is the plot ratio? How many floors? Is the building with or without elevators? How many households are there per floor? Is a household with one-hall-two-room or two-hall-three-room? Is the house with or without decoration?\nAs the option is subdivided, the rent will change. Suppose the option C is divided into two sub-options: villa and apartment, the above numerical example will become like this:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Agricultural Land\n100\n300\n-200\n\n\nB：Industrial Land\n200\n300\n-100\n\n\nC1：Residential Land-Villa\n250\n300\n-50\n\n\nC2：Residential Land-Apartment\n300\n200\n50\n\n\n\n\nTable 12-3\n\n\nAs shown in Table 12-3, the rent of the optimum falls to 50 from the original 100 simply because the option C is subdivided. Attention: The optimum of C2 here is exactly the same as the previous optimum of C. The option C previously describes building an apartment on the land roughly as “residential land”, while the option C2 now more specifically describes it as “apartment”. And as the description becomes more specific, it can be seen that there is the option C1 of villa between B and C2. Thus, if the option C is subdivided, the suboptimum is no longer option B, but C1, so now it is the income of C1 instead of B becomes the cost of the optimum of C2. Since the income of C1 is higher than that of B, the cost of the optimum of C2 rises and the rent falls.\nIf the option C is further subdivided, until there are countless options within it, and then they are sorted by their incomes, the above numerical examples will become like this:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Agricultural Land\n100\n300\n-200\n\n\nB：Industrial Land\n200\n300\n-100\n\n\nC1：Residential Land-Villa\n250\n300\n-50\n\n\n……\n\n\n\n\n\nCn-1\n299.99999…\n300\n-0.0000…1\n\n\nCn\n300\n299.99999…\n0.0000…1\n\n\n\n（Note：n is infinity）\n\nTable 12-4\n\n\nThe optimum of Cn can be described in detail as a 10-storied apartment with elevators, two households per floor, each household with two-hall-three-room, with refined decoration ... And Then a suboptimum of Cn-1 can be always found, which is almost exactly the same as Cn except for a slight difference (such as a slight difference in decoration or in orientation), so the income of it is also only a little difference (299.99999 ..., with an infinite number of 9) from that of Cn’s (300). With the option of C subdivided infinitely, the income of Cn-1 is the cost of Cn, which is also infinitely close to the income of Cn, and the rent is infinitely close to 0 from the direction of the positive number axis. By contrast, the rent of Cn-1 is infinitely close to 0 from the direction of the negative number axis.\nThere is another opposite direction for dealing with the options of how to use the land. Instead of infinite subdivision，the most rough division is to divide it into only two options like this:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Use\n0\n300\n-300\n\n\nB：Not Use\n300\n0\n300\n\n\n\n\nTable 12-5\n\n\nIf the land is left unused, the income will naturally be 0, so the cost of using it (specifically, building a 10-storied apartment on the land) will be also 0, and all the income will be rent.\nLook back at the statement at the very beginning of this section: Rent is amazing in that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes even zero! The option is in fact always the same one which is objective and has never changed. What has changed is how to observe the option and to what degree the option is subdivided.\nIt is logically similar that if observed from the galaxy, the earth is a particle which means it is a body only with mass and without volume. However, if observed much more closely, like from the solar system, the earth can no longer be regarded as a particle without volume, but as a blue planet. Then if observed within the atmosphere of the earth, it is a combination of mud, rock, water and air. At last, if observed the most closely with a microscope, the earth is a compound of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and other atoms. It is always the same earth which is objective has never changed. What has changed is how closely to observe it.\nWhy are there different observations about the options? Because different problems need to be observed differently, just as different physics problems involving the earth need to be observed from different distances. For example, for the government, when it plans the use of a piece of land, it only needs to roughly divide the options into agricultural land, industrial land and residential land, and choose the option that can bring the highest rent to the society. If the land is planned to be used for building houses, the government will auction the land for residential use. The developers who come to bid will choose the option of villa or apartment depending on which can bring the highest rent. When the developers have bought the land and start construction, they will subdivide the options most specifically. Suppose they choose to build an apartment, they need to choose among all these options: what is the plot ratio? How many floors? Is the apartment with or without elevators? How many households are there per floor? Is a household with one-hall-two-room or two-hall-three-room? Is the house with or without decoration? ...... It is subject to which can bring the highest rent.\nAs mentioned before, self-interested human will choose the option with maximal rent. It can be seen from the numerical example that although the rent varies from large to small or even to zero along with the options being more and more sub-divided, no matter how the rent changes, the optimum of rent maximization is always the same one, and the relevant rent is always non-negative. In fact, only the rent of the optimum is non-negative. In other words, people do not need to calculate the exact value of the rent, but only need to know whether it is negative. If the rent of an option is negative, it must not be the optimum. It is also why rent maximization (non-negative rent) is often a better angle than income maximization or cost minimization. In reality, there is constraint of information cost, and the formation cost of judging whether the rent is non-negative is usually the least.\nLet us review the two extreme situations: one is the most infinite subdivision of options, and the other is the roughest division that there are only two options of “use” and “not use”.\nIn the former case, the rent of the optimum is 0 and the cost is equal to the income. In other words, income is essentially cost. As mentioned in the previous lecture, the (opportunity) cost in economics is not expenditure used in daily life, but income which is the income of the sub-optimum given up rather than that of the optimum. However, it can be concluded from the above analysis that when the options are infinitely subdivided, the cost of the optimum is the income of itself.\nIn the latter case, the cost is 0 and the rent is equal to the income. In other words, income is essentially rent.\nDeduced from these two extremes, when it is normal situation, rent is essentially cost. All income is cost, only part of it is the cost of the options observed, and part of it is the cost of the options not observed. In order to distinguish the options observed and not observed, the former is directly called “cost” and the latter is called “rent”, but in essence they are both costs. Thus, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost. It is a very important statement, because it is determined by self-interest and competition. And the implication of it is the “Zero-Profit Theorem” that will be introduced later.\n"},"Lecture12/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture12/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Concept of Rent from the First Perspective","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Concept of Rent from the First Perspective\nThe concept of rent has not been introduced until now, because it is much easier to understand based on the explanation in previous section. There are two perspectives for the understanding of the concept of rent, which are actually the same.\nFrom the first perspective of the historical evolution of the concept, rent is the income of production factor or the value of asset. Maybe many readers have guessed from the term of rent that it originally referred to the rent of land. That is right! In the period of classical economics, although the industrial revolution had begun in Britain, economists were still mainly concerned about the activities in agriculture. And land is the most important production factor in agriculture, so rent of land, as the income of land, was analyzed in detail by classical economists.\nAs mentioned in the previous lecture, classical economists advocated the theory of labor value which means the value of a good only comes from labor, so the income from a good should only be distributed to labor. However, when classical economists observed agricultural production, they faced a huge puzzle: why can a landlord collect rent? The rent of land is, of course, the income of land, but the landlord does not work by himself, and just leases the land to the farmers who work.\nThis obvious fact clearly has refuted the theory of labor value and hit classical economists hard. When a theory is refuted by facts, what a scientist should do is either to revise the theory or completely abandon it. In the previous lecture, we have introduced how Ricardo tried to revise the theory of labor value by narrowing the scope of application to exclude antiques which obviously refuted the theory regarding historical cost as cost. Of course, his revision failed to save the theory, because there are many goods other than antiques such as masks during SARS that also refute it. That is why economists completely abandoned the theory of labor at last, replacing historical cost with opportunity cost.\nHowever, there is also another unscientific way: to use subjective value judgment to deny the objective facts. For example, when the price of mask during SARS rose sharply, people including laymen and incompetent or impudent economists would like to accuse mask suppliers of making profit when the nation was in trouble. They simply labeled the suppliers as immoral without any scientific explanation for the rise in price, which was essentially ostrichism refusing to face the reality. If this kind of ostrich policy became the basis for government’s decision, it would be impossible to effectively solve the problems because the relevant behavior (rise in the price of masks) had not been scientifically explained. As a result, government would impose such s counterproductive policy as price control.\nThe theory of labor value only regards labor as the only source of the value of a good, which has been clearly refuted by the fact that a landlord who does not work at all can collect rent. Marx defined the collection of rent by a landlord as “exploitation”, which meant he still insisted that all income from land should only be distributed to labor, and just a part of the income was exploited by the landlord in the form of rent. Marx lived in the era of industrialization, so when he further extended this “exploitation theory” to industrial production, he naturally deduced the “theory of surplus value” that capitalist exploit workers.\nThe concept of exploitation is full of subjective value judgment (moral judgment). And if it is regarded as truth, the policy proposal must be prohibition of landlords from exploiting farmers, which means landlords are not allowed to collect rent, so that farmers get all the income from lands. However, if landlords could not get any income, they must take back their lands and not lease to farmers as a countermeasure. Then how could agricultural production be carried out without lands and only with the labor of farmers? As a result, if one insisted on the theory of labor value in classical economics, he must also insist on the exploitation theory and the theory of surplus value of Marx, and finally he would logically come to the conclusion that he must advocate “public ownership” which completely deprive landlords of their PPRs of lands and transfer to the nation. Then lands are not owned by specific individuals, but owned by an ambiguous subject, which ensures that lands will be input to agricultural production even if no rent could be collected.\nHowever, public ownership completely violates PPRs, and completely eliminates the market or the price as competition criterion, thus leading to huge rent dissipation (one kind of transaction costs), which results in economy recession and even collapse. Self-interested people have to give up public ownership and return to private ownership in order to reduce transaction cost and survive. One can refuse to face the reality like ostriches, but the reality will not change because he pretends not to see it. Economic laws are the same as physical laws, regardless of whether one likes or not. Whoever does not abide by them will be severely punished.\nBack to the concept of rent. The reason why a landlord can collect rent is because the land he owns does contribute to production and is one of the sources of value for the output (agricultural products). Therefore, part of the income from the land must be distributed to the land, actually to the owner of the land. Thus, rent is the income distributed to the land for its contribution to the agricultural production.\nLater, Marshall discovered that not only the income of land is rent, but the incomes of all kinds of production factors are also rents. For example, the income of the so-called capitalist does not come from exploitation of the surplus value of workers as Marx said, but from the provisions of two types of production factors.\nFirstly, he provides capital, which means he lends his money to himself for production, so he requires relevant income. Seen from the concept of opportunity cost, the essence of it is rather easy to understand. If he does not use the money for production but deposits it in a bank, he has interest as income. Now he uses the money for production, thus giving up the interest of saving, which is his opportunity cost. In fact, when he deposits the money in a bank, the bank just play the role of intermediary to help him lend the money to others who need funds. Therefore, the interest he gives up is the income he can obtain by lending the money to others for production. Seen from another perspective, if he does not use his own money, he can borrow money from a bank, and needs to pay interest. In a word, using one’s own money is actually borrowing money. Just because he borrows money from himself, he pays the interest to himself.\nSecondly, the so-called capitalist provides his own labor in management and other aspects, which is mainly mental labor. Blue-collar workers provide mainly manual labor, while white-collar workers provide mainly mental labor. In essence, he rents his labor to himself for production, so he requires relevant income. Seen from the concept of opportunity cost, the essence of it is also rather easy to understand. What he gives up is the wage of renting his own labor to others for production. Therefore, the difference between working for others and self-employment does not lie in whether the labor is rented out or not, but only in whom the salary is paid to.\nIn Marx’s era, the owner and the manager of a firm were the same person, so Marx could not see clearly that this person actually had played two roles at the same time, and had two incomes at the same time: one is the income of interest as the owner of his own capital, the other is the income of wage as the owner of his own labor. It is somewhat logically similar the situation mentioned in the previous lecture that when there is information cost, historical cost and opportunity cost cannot be clearly separated, so economists misunderstood that people made decisions according to historical cost. Nowadays, corporation has become a very popular form of firm. It is clear that shareholders (the owners of the firm, or strictly speaking, the owners of capital) and managers (strictly speaking, the owners of mental labor) can be two different groups of persons. Shareholders receive dividends, while managers receive salaries, so the owners of different production factors all have their own income. Thus, the income of various production factors is actually the rent paid for leasing them for production.\nSince the income of all production factors is their own rent, Marshall generalized the term of “rent” from a narrow sense which only referred to the rent of land to a broad sense which refers to the income of all production factors. At first, in order to distinguish from the narrow sense of rent that people were used to understand, he called the rent in broad sense as “economic rent” or “quasi-rent”. As many developed countries have developed from agricultural economy to industrial economy, the concept of rent is generally recognized in economics as referring to the broad sense.\nLook back on the example of the options of a piece of land. There are only two options “Use” and “Not use” when the most roughly observed. It is obvious that “rent of land is the income of land” is actually a particular case of “rent is the income of production factors”.\nAs will be explained in the later lecture on “Interest Theory”, any that can bring in income is an asset. The purpose of inputting factors to production is to share a part of the output, so production factors are all assets. And assets are valuable because they can contribute to production and get income from it. As mentioned in previous section, income is rent, so rent is the value of the asset. In fact, all that human need is asset, no matter whether they are needed for production or consumption. Consumer goods can also be regarded as production factors, because they can be regarded as reproduction of the labor capacity in human. Thus, all that human need is valuable, can bring in income and has rent. Fundamentally speaking, the value of it is determined by the two constraints of self-interest and scarcity which jointly determine the price of it, and the price constitutes the income for the producers, so the relevant income is the rent of it.\nWe should be flexible in thinking and observe the same phenomenon from different angles, and then we can really understand how the concepts in economics are connected with each other.\n"},"Lecture12/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture12/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Concept of Rent from the Second Perspective","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Concept of Rent from the Second Perspective\nSeen from the second perspective, rent is the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. This definition sounds very difficult to understand, let’s give an example. Classical economists noticed an obvious feature of land that the supply of it seemed unchanged. There is so much land on earth, which will not change due to the change in rent of land (income from land). Therefore, rent seems to be a “surplus” of income, which means even if the rent of land falls to zero, there is still so much land available on earth. Some of classical economists such as Henry George advocated that government should impose all taxes on landlords, so that even if their income of rent dropped to 0, the supply of land would not be affected, thus neither would the whole economy be affected.\nHowever, is it really the case? As mentioned in the previous section, if a landlord is not allowed to obtain rent of land based on the exploitation theory of Marx, he will take back the land from the agricultural production. In other words, if the rent of land is really reduced to 0, landlords will choose not to use the land, so that although there is much land on earth, the amount of land that is effectively supplied to the market is 0.\nWhat if the rent significantly decreases but does not drop to 0? It is similar to the effect of price control which is strongly enforced, and effectively prohibits of all kinds of means such as contract fee from going around it. Suppose the price control stipulates the rent of a house cannot be more than RMB800 a month, the houses originally worth more than RMB800 would be withdrawn from the house renting market, and switched to the factory or shop leasing market or simply sold out. In other words, a piece of land or a house can be supplied not only to the market of a specific production, so the supply of it will decrease with the decrease of rent in that specific market.\nWhat is more, a landlord can also reduce the quality of his house to a level compatible with the regulated price of RMB800 such as no provision of furniture and no maintenance of the house. The houses originally worth RMB1000 are still supplied to the house renting market under the rent control of RMB800, which seems that RMB200 of rent is a surplus. However, does the supply of landlords really not change? No! The supply of the houses with high quality which are so high-priced decreases completely to 0! Only the houses with low quality compatible with the regulated rent of RMB800 are supplied to the market.\nHere is another example of rent decrease not caused by price control, because it is more universal and there is not additional effect of rent dissipation caused by price control. As we all know, there are many houses around a university for students to rent, and there is obvious seasonal fluctuation of rent. The beginning of each semester is the peak season for the houses, so the rent will rise to the highest at that time. And the end of each semester, especially the Spring Festival in winter vacation, is the off season for the houses, so the rent will drop to the lowest at this time. Suppose the rent in peak season is RMB1000, while that in off season is RMB800. The rent has changed, but the supply of the houses does not change. The difference of RMB200 seems to be a surplus. However, although the supply of the houses remains unchanged, do the landlords really not change at all? Of course not. The landlords in peak season will be more active in cleaning their houses, and may even spend money on renovating the houses, so as to increase the quality of the houses to the level that worth the rent of RMB1000. By contrast, in off season, landlords will be less active in maintaining their houses in the best condition to attract tenants. In other words, the quantity supplied remains unchanged, while the quality supplied has changed.\nThe thought that change in the income of land will not cause change in the supply of it, just because the options are observed roughly, so that only two options of “Use” and “Not use” are observed. It seems as if the supply of land will not change until the rent falls to 0. However, if the option of “Use” is further subdivided, there are in fact many sub-options included in it, such as used as “agricultural land”, “industrial land” and “residential land”. For example, if the income from agricultural land falls, some of the lands will be withdrawn from the market of agricultural land and turn to that of other uses of land. Of course, there are still some lands unchanged in the supply of agricultural land. However, there are also in fact many sub-options in the option of agricultural land, such as growing different crops, with or without fertilizer, and so on. The agricultural lands have actually changed to some extend along with the change in the income, but just have not changed beyond the scope of the “agricultural land”. Thus they seem to have not changed, and there seems to be part of income when the supply does not change with the income, which is precisely rent. In other words, it is again the amazing feature of rent that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes zero depending on how the options are observed.\nThere is rent not because the behaviors such as supply have not changed, but the changing options are not observed. Remind the statement in section 2: All income is cost, only part of it is the cost of the options observed, and part of it is the cost of the options not observed. In order to distinguish the options observed and not observed, the former is directly called “cost” and the latter is called “rent”. Now it should be easier to understand this second perspective from which the definition of rent is the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. The part of income where the supply is observed to change with the income has classified as cost, while the part of income where the supply is not observed to change with the income is regarded as unchanged and classified as rent.\nThe rent of land can be generalized to that of all other production factors or assets. Take Elvis Presley as the example of labor. Elvis Presley was a truck driver before he became a popular singer, and earned just a few hundred dollars a month at that time. By contrast, he earned tens of millions of dollars every year as a singer. For the sake of simplicity, suppose he earned $1,000 a year when he was a driver, while he earned $10 million a year when he was a singer. As shown in Table 12-6, the rent of Elvis Presley as a singer was as high as $9.999 million, which meant he would not change from a singer to a driver until his income as a singer dropped from $10 million to $1,000, so he seemed to be unchanged in supply of singer.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Driver\n0.001\n10\n-9.999\n\n\nB：Singer\n10\n0.001\n9.999\n\n\n\n（Unit: Million US Dollar）\n\nTable 12-6\n\n\nHowever, it is only because the options of Elvis Presley are observed too roughly, and he is thought to have only two options: “Driver” and “Singer”. In fact, the option of “Singer” can be subdivided into numerous sub-options, such as choosing different record companies, choosing different songs, choosing to release albums or to hold concerts, choosing to sing more or less songs, even choosing to laugh more or less ... all are different sub-options. If all the sub-options are sorted by their incomes, the income of the sub-optimum must be infinitely close to that of the optimum, thus is the cost of the optimum, and the rent of the optimum is infinitely close to 0.\nIn fact, the case shown in Table 12-6 is not the roughest observation of Elvis Presley’s options. Both “Driver” and “Singer” are jobs, and are the same option if observed most roughly. There are only options of “Work” and “Not work” if observed most roughly, which is shown in Table 12-7 that Elvis Presley’s rent reached the maximum of $10 million when all his income was rent. Is it essentially the same as the options of “Use” and “Not use” for a piece of land? Thus, not only the supply of land does not change with income, but it is also the same for labor, actually for all production factors or assets. Classical economists thought that the feature of the rent of land is unique, but is actually universal.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Driver\n0\n10\n-10\n\n\nB：Singer\n10\n0\n10\n\n\n\n（Unit: Million US Dollar）\n\nTable 12-7\n\n\nAfter explaining the two perspectives for understanding the concept of rent, readers should find them the same in essence.\nFrom the first perspective, rent is the income of production factor or the value of asset, which is the roughest observation of options, so all the income of production factor or asset is rent. From the second perspective, options are not sub-divided into countless sub-options, so some options have not been observed, and it seems that the supply does not change with the income, and part of income is regarded as rent.\nAlthough the two perspectives are essentially the same, it is still necessary to distinguish from which perspective the concept of rent is used in a specific case. For example, the “rent” in “rent dissipation” refers to the concept from the first perspective, because it means the loss in the income of an asset when the price of it is regulated. And the concept of overhead cost to be introduced in the next lecture is essentially rent from the second perspective, because it means that income fluctuation in an industry does not necessarily cause producers to leave the market and reduce supply.\n"},"Lecture12/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture12/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: Profit","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: Profit\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, it is inappropriate for MSE to use the term “profit” to refer to the difference between income and (opportunity) cost. After the explanation of the concept of rent in previous sections, readers should understand the concept of rent is far beyond the scope of that of profit. In essence, profit in MSE is a concept defined by a mathematical formula, which is not as rich in economic implication as rent.\nMore importantly, the term “profit” needs to be defined differently from rent in this book and profit in MSE. We define “profit” as the difference between actual income and opportunity cost.\nAs has stressed in the previous lecture of “the Concept of Cost”, cost in economics must refer to that in the future, which is completely different from the actual expenditure (historical cost or accounting cost) in the past. In other words, cost must be expected cost. Expectation is intention, not a fact, but it can be deduced by examining the objective facts that make the expectation come into being. It is logically similar that income in economics is expected income, not actual one. Before making a choice, one expects the future, which means he expects the income and cost in the future, and the difference between them is rent, and then he makes a choice according to the principle of rent maximization. When the choice has been made, the difference between actual income and expected cost (opportunity cost) is profit.\nBased on the previous lecture and this lecture, there are three formulas: (1) rent＝expected income－expected cost (opportunity cost); (2) accounting profit＝actual income－actual cost (historical cost/accounting cost); (3) profit＝actual income－expected cost (opportunity cost). As mentioned before, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost, so expected income＝expected cost (opportunity cost) as long as options are sub-divided into countless sub-options. Thus, the formula of profit can be rewritten as: profit＝actual income－expected income. In other words, profit is essentially unexpected income.\nOnce a choice is made, it is like the water poured out, which means the actual income, just like historical cost, will no longer affect people’s choice. Similarly, profit cannot affect people’s choice, because whether there is profit and how much it is cannot be expected. People choose according to expectation, so profit beyond expectation is meaningless.\nFor example, if one accidentally picks up a wallet when he walks on a road, it is his unexpected income or profit. If one accidentally loses his wallet instead, it is also his unexpected (negative) income or (negative) profit. Thus profit can be positive or negative.\nThere is profit because there is information cost which makes one’s expected income different from actual income: he does not know in advance that he can pick or lose wallet on the road. As long as the constraint of information cost remains unchanged, profit cannot affect people’s behavior. One will not walk on that road every day after accidentally picking a wallet and expects to pick a wallet again. Neither will he avoid walking on that road just because he has accidentally lost his wallet and expects to lose it again.\n"},"Lecture13/":{"url":"Lecture13/","title":"Lecture 13: Direct Cost and Overhead Cost","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 13: Direct Cost and Overhead Cost\n"},"Lecture13/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture13/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: The Fallacy of Fixed Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: The Fallacy of Fixed Cost\nIn MSE, it is said that cost is the sum of fixed cost and variable cost. The so-called “fixed cost” refers to the cost of fixed input that cannot be changed in short run, while “variable cost” refers to the cost of variable input. However, what is “short run”? It refers to the period when part of cost is fixed, which means there is fixed cost, while “long run” refers to the period when all costs are variable. There is obvious logical problem of circular reasoning in MSE about fixed cost. Economists cannot clearly say how short the short-run is, but that it is short-run if producers have not changed all the inputs, while fixed cost is defined based on the period is too short for the inputs to be changed, which is in fact a tautology.\nWhat is more, there is also a fatal fallacy for the concept of fixed cost. Producers cannot change the fixed inputs in short run, which means they do not have the option of changing the fixed inputs in short run. However, as has stressed in the lecture of “the Concept of Cost”, there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Since there is no option of changing the fixed inputs, how can there be cost?\nEssentially fixed cost is historical cost, which comes from the production factors called “fixed assets” in accounting that need to be purchased or rented before production. However, historical cost is not cost. Before these production factors are purchased or rented, there are costs for them. Once they have been purchased or rented and the relevant price or rent is paid, these expenditures become historical costs, and are not costs any longer.\nIt is the most serious fallacy in the theory of firm in MSE: on the one hand, at the very beginning, it is stressed that cost in economics is opportunity cost, not historical cost; on the other hand, when it is comes to cost function (and hence production function) later on, fixed cost which is essentially historical cost is put into the cost function, and it seems that the concept of opportunity cost is completely forgotten.1\nIf we insist that cost is opportunity cost, not historical cost, what are the costs of the so-called fixed assets that have been purchased or rented before production? Obviously, the costs of these production factors after they have been purchased or rented should be the income given up if they are resold or sublet, which is an alternative to retaining these production factors.\nIf we insist that cost is opportunity cost, not historical cost, what are the costs of the so-called fixed assets that have been purchased or rented before production? Obviously, the costs of these production factors after they have been purchased or rented should be the income given up if they are resold or sublet, which is an alternative to retaining these production factors.\nFor example, when a machine breaks down and stops production for one hour, except that electricity can be saved, it seems that all other inputs cannot be changed, and belong to fixed input, the cost of which fixed cost. However, is it really impossible to change these inputs? In principle, the boss can immediately dismiss all workers, and resell or sublet other machines, equipments or even the buildings. Of course, it is crazy to do so for just one hour of production suspension. Yes, producers will not do so, but it is just that they do not choose to do so, not that they have no such options! There is no cost if there is no option, while there is cost if there is such an option which is not chosen.\nWhy is the option not chosen? Because it is too costly. It is very troublesome to dismiss all workers, resell or sublet other machines, equipments and buildings within one hour. And it is even more troublesome to buy or rent back all the necessary production factors again when production resumes in an hour. The description “to be troublesome” in daily use means “there is high transaction cost”. The benefit of paying such a high transaction cost is only to save the waste caused by these production factors which have been idling for one hour, which is not worth it.\nHowever, if the production suspension lasts for one day, the boss will choose to dismiss temporary workers, because they are paid on a daily basis, and the transaction cost for dismissal and re-recruitment is very low. It is less costly compared with the alternative of paying their wages even they need not work.\nWhen the production suspension lasts for a month, the transaction cost for dismissal and re-recruitment of workers employed on a monthly basis also becomes lower than the cost of keeping them. It is the same for the machines and equipments leased on a monthly basis.\nFinally, if the boss plans to permanently shut down, there is no need to buy or rent back all the production factors again, and the transaction cost for resale or sublet machines, equipments and buildings also drops to a level worth being chosen.\nThe above example only shows the case of production reduction, and it is similar for the case of production increase. For example, a boss of restaurant will only employ part-time workers to help during the peak hours of meal time, and will not increase the area of the restaurant. It seems that labor is variable factor, while the area of the restaurant is fixed factor. But the reason is just that the transaction cost of changing the area of the restaurant is obviously higher than that of changing the employment of part-time workers.\nIf a restaurant continues to thrive, the boss is sure to expand the area. There has been a small porridge shop near my home. Because the porridge is very delicious and the price is rather cheap, it has become so popular with the residents nearby, that there are much more customers than the tables in the peak time of the morning, and many of them have to stand outside the shop to have porridge. At first the boss only rented one shop front, and then he rents another shop front beside it to increase the business area.\nThus, it is not that producers have no options, but there is transaction cost, which makes it more difficult for some production factors to change immediately along with the changes in output than others. The transaction cost is precisely the cost of choosing to change. If it is too high, producers will not choose to change.\nIt is Marshall who invented the concepts of short-run and long-run term in MSE. He actually felt that there was transaction cost of changing inputs, but he did not even know the correct concept of opportunity cost. There is no concept of transaction cost in economics until Coase discovered it almost 50 years later. So Marshall invented these two concepts to avoid using the concept of transaction cost to explain producers’ behaviors of choosing to change some inputs but choosing not to change other inputs. However, as mentioned earlier, there is logical problem of circular reasoning for these two concepts and fixed cost, and it is essentially a tautology that never really explains producers’ behaviors. What is more, the concept of fixed cost is essentially historical cost, which is out of line with the concept of opportunity cost.\n\n\n1. Why is there such obvious inconsistency in MSE? The reason is that there had been the theory of the cost of production before the concept of opportunity cost. It is Marshall who came up with the theory about the cost of production, but there had not been the correct concept of opportunity cost in economics at that time, so the wrong concept of historical cost was still prevalent. Therefore, when Marshall thought about the cost of production, he still used the concept of historical cost, not opportunity cost at all.As pointed out in the previous two lectures, there are two mistakes in the theory of labor value: one is that labor is regarded as the only source of the value of a good, and the other is that historical cost (the labor input during the production) is cost. Marshall had realized the former mistake in the theory of labor value, and found that other factors besides labor also contribute to production and create value, so they should also have relevant income in return. However, he did not fully realize the latter mistake in the theory of labor value, and continued to bring this mistake into the theory about the cost of production.When opportunity cost has been accepted as the correct concept of cost in economics, economists should revise all the theories came up with before the concept of opportunity cost including the theory about the cost of production with the wrong concept of fixed cost. However, economists have not done so, which causes that there is such obvious inconsistency between the concept of opportunity cost and fixed cost in MSE. Now we are doing so to eliminate any concept or theory inconsistent with the concept of opportunity cost. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture13/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture13/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: Direct Cost and Overhead Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: Direct Cost and Overhead Cost\nAbandoning the concepts of short-run and long-run, and facing the reality where there is transaction cost, how should we analyze the cost of production? A more objective criterion can be used to divide it into two kinds: one is the cost when there is output and it changes along with the change of output, which is called “direct cost” (DC), and is equivalent to variable cost in MSE. The other is the cost even when there is no output, which is called “overhead cost” (OC), but it is different from fixed cost in MSE.\nThere are three statements about overhead cost. (1) The definition of overhead cost is: when producers choose to continue to do business, the cost that they have to bear even without production is called overhead cost. (2) The calculation formula of overhead cost is: income－direct cost. (3) The essence of overhead cost is: the asset value of the whole business, i.e. the rent. These three statements can be deduced from each other. The following is an example of a training agency.\nSuppose one is considering whether to do the business of a training agency. For the sake of simplicity, suppose there are only two production factors needed: rooms for classrooms and electricity. Labor (including the boss, recruiters, and teachers, etc.) is excluded here because it is a very complex production factor, the cost of which is not easy to distinguished as direct cost or overhead cost. Therefore, although it is impossible not to use labor in any production, in order to prevent beginners from confusing, let us simplify the assumption to so unrealistic first. Later, we will extend the assumption to more realistic.\nFirstly, one investigates the market and finds that once he enters the market of training agency, only when there are courses, there will be the cost of electricity, because he turns on the lights and computers during a course, and can turn off them if there is no course to avoid such costs. Thus, electricity charge is the direct cost after entering the market. Suppose according to the investigation, if there are courses every night, per month the income is RMB1000, the electricity charge will be RMB200, and the rent for the classrooms is RMB800. In other words, income can cover all costs, so he decides to enter the market.\nSomeone may ask: income only covers all costs, which means there is no profit, why will one choose to enter the market? If one does not enter a market unless there is profit, in fact there are other production factors such as labor, capital, etc. The so-called profit is used to cover the cost of these other production factors. As mentioned in Lecture12, one who works for himself and use his own money also needs to pay wage and interest for himself, so the profit is actually not profit, but just the wage and interest paid to cover the cost of his own labor and money. And in the example of training agency here, for the sake of simplicity, it is supposed only two production factors (room and electricity) are needed. In other words, other production factors including the labor and money of the boss himself are assumed not to be needed or to be free, so he does not need so-called profit to cover all these costs. It is called zero-profit theorem in economics which will be introduced in the later lecture.\nBefore entering the market, all costs (rent of classrooms and electricity charge) are direct costs, because one can choose not to enter, and does not need to bear these costs, which means there will be no such cost if there is no production.\nAnd then, one has paid the rent of classrooms for one year, and the cost equivalent to RMB800 a month will immediately become historical cost. In principle, after entering the market, as long as the income from the market is higher than the direct cost of electricity (RMB200), one will continue to do business, because the rent of RMB800 has become historical cost which should not affect his behavior. However, if one expects the income from the market only more than RMB200 but less than RMB1000 before entering the market, he will not choose to enter, because at that time, the rent of RMB800 is still direct cost, not historical cost.\nAfter entering the market, one may find the income of tuition is RMB1000 as expected. After deducting the electricity charge of RMB200, the net income is RMB800 which can cover the rent paid when entering the market. This net income is precisely overhead cost according to the calculation formula of “overhead cost＝income－direct cost”. It seems that overhead cost is the same as fixed cost which is historical cost paid when entering the market, but it is only equal in value and completely different in essence. The essence of fixed cost is historical cost, not (opportunity) cost, while the essence of overhead cost is rent which is (opportunity) cost.\nWhy? Suppose that one night there is no course for some reason, one will turn off the lights and the computers to save the direct cost of electricity. But how about the cost of the classrooms? Regardless of the relevant transaction cost, theoretically one can choose to sublet the unused classrooms on that night, and the rent he gets is the opportunity cost of the classrooms. Thus, the rent of subletting the classrooms is the cost even when there is no production (the rooms are unused), which is the overhead cost.\nThe question is: how much will someone else be willing to offer to rent the rooms? The answer is: it must be equivalent to RMB800/30 days, because it is only one night’s rent and RMB800 is the rent of a month. The rent someone else is willing to pay cannot be higher than the income from using the rooms. Suppose someone else also uses the rooms as classrooms for training agency, exactly the same as the lessor. The rooms have been arranged to be suitable as classrooms for training agency, so it is better to use them in the same way, otherwise there will be additional cost. In other words, the option consistent with income maximization or cost minimization is to use the rooms in the same way as the lessor, which is to use them as the classrooms for training agency. Since the rooms are used in the same way, the income must be also the same, which is equivalent to RMB800/30 days or the difference of income (RMB1000) and direct cost of electricity charge (RMB200).\nThus, the concept of overhead cost is consistent with the calculation formula. When there is no output, the income from transferring an idle asset is the opportunity cost of not transferring it. And the price at which someone else is willing to buy it is the indifference between the income the lessee can get and the direct cost. Since the best way for the lessee to use the asset in the same way as the lessor, his income is also the same as that of the lessor. Therefore, the overhead cost of the asset is the difference between the income and the direct cost.\nCaution: income, direct cost and overhead cost are all expected value, not actual one. If it has happened, it has become history. Take the business of training agency as example, when one has got RMB1000 as the income, and has paid RMB200 as the electricity charge, so has earned 800RMB as the net income which can make up for the rent of the rooms in the first month, all of these are no longer (expected) income, (expected) direct cost and (expected) overhead cost. Now one needs to estimate the income and electricity charge of the next month. The business in the first month has strengthened his expectation, so he will continue to expect the income of the next month to be also RMB1000, the electricity charge RMB200, and the net income RMB800, all of which are (expected) income, (expected) direct cost and (expected) overhead cost.\nAs mentioned earlier, overhead cost appears to be equal in value to fixed cost (historical cost) just when the expectation is correct. If the expectation is incorrect, overhead cost will be no longer equal to fixed cost. For example, suppose the income in the first month is RMB900 instead of RMB1000, and the electricity charge is still RMB200, so the net income becomes RMB700. The actual income (RMB900) is lower than the expectation (RMB1000), so there is RMB100 of (negative) profit which is unexpected (negative) income.\nNow one still needs to estimate the income and electricity charge of the next month. If he thinks that the loss of RMB100 in this month is just an accidental loss which will not last in the next month, he will continue to expect the income of the next month to be also RMB1000, the electricity charge RMB200, and the net income RMB800, which means the overhead cost is still RMB800, not RMB700! Here it is very clear that overhead cost is not the difference between actual income and direct cost, but (expected) income and direct cost.\nHowever, if one thinks the actual income lower than expected one not because of accidental bad luck but inaccurate information about the market, he should adjust his estimate about the situation in the next month. Suppose one expects the income of the next month to be RMB900, the electricity charge is still RMB200, and the net income or overhead cost RMB700.\nReaders can deduce the contrary situation when the performance is better than expected by imitating the above analysis.\nThus it is clear that if one adjusts his expectation, overhead cost will be different from fixed cost, and can change along with the change in expectation. By contrast, fixed cost is, of course, fixed, and will never change, because it is essentially historical cost, and what has become history will never change again.\nThe analysis above is the most simplified, so next we will extend the analysis by relaxing the assumptions.\nSuppose there are more than two production factors, they can be classified into those similar to rooms and those similar to electricity. The costs of the production factors similar to electricity are all direct costs, and the costs of the production factors similar to rooms are all overhead costs. When there is no output, instead of transferring only an idle production factor (such as room), the whole business (excluding production factors similar to electricity is transferred, and the income will be the rent of the whole business. Thus, this rent is the overhead cost of the whole business, which is shown in Table 13-1.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Shutdown\n0\nIncome－DC\n－OC\n\n\nB：No Shutdown\nIncome－DC\n0\nOC\n\n\n\n\nTable 13-1\n\n\nAs has been explained in the previous lecture, there will be rent if the options are observed roughly. Overhead cost is rent, because only two options are roughly observed: shutdown (to withdraw from the market) and no shutdown (to stay in the market and continue the business). Obviously, as long as there is overhead cost, even if the income is less than expectation, but at least can still cover the direct cost, producer will not choose to shut down. In other words, overhead cost can be regarded as rent from the second perspective which means the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. Here even if the income from the market has decreased to be less than expectation, producer still chooses not to shut down or stay in the market to continue the business, so the supply does not change. It is why the essence of overhead cost is rent.\nTo sum up, the definition, the calculation formula and the essence of overhead cost can be deduced from each other.\n"},"Lecture13/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture13/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: The Explanation of Producers’ Behaviors with Overhead Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: The Explanation of Producers’ Behaviors with Overhead Cost\nThe concept of overhead cost is very important because it can explain many producers’ behaviors.\nFirstly, it is overhead cost that determines the shutdown decision of producers.\nAs can be seen from the analysis in the previous section, even if income (RMB900) is lower than expectation (RMB1000), producers will not choose to shutdown, unless income falls so low that it cannot cover direct cost (RMB200). In other words, whether producers stay in the market and continue the business depends on overhead cost.\nIn reality, income always fluctuates, but producers will not shutdown the business frequently. As long as one expects income will not decline to be lower than direct cost, he will stay in the market, and what he loses is part overhead cost, which is the “pain” he can bear. However, once income drops to lower than direct cost, producers will shut down immediately.1 For an analogy, direct cost is like bone, while overhead cost is like fat. Producers experience economic recession just as animals experience winter. The thicker the fat (the higher the overhead cost), the longer animals can survive (the longer producers can survive). And once the knife cuts into the bone (income falls to be lower than direct cost), animals will die (producers will shut down business or be knocked out of the market).\nSecondly, logically deduced from the first key point, in order not to be knocked out of the market, producers must try to maximize overhead cost. The zero-profit theorem mentioned in the previous section determines that producers actually cannot have profit. In MSE, it is said that what producers try to maximize is profit, which is completely wrong and again is a big mistake of MSE.\nIt sounds ridiculous that the target of producers is overhead cost maximization, because cost seems to ought to be minimized. However, the essence of overhead cost is rent, and rent maximization is rather reasonable. To be precise, the “cost” in cost minimization should refer to direct cost, not overhead cost. As mentioned in Lecture 12, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost. If cost minimization means that all costs are minimized, is it not similar to income minimization? Obviously, it is not correct. In order to survive the fierce and cruel market competition, producers must strive for as much overhead cost as possible to protect them. Ceteris Paribus, producers with higher overhead cost can survive longer in economic or industrial recession with income declining.\nTo increase overhead cost, there are two directions: one is to reduce direct cost as much as possible, and the other is to increase income as much as possible, which is subject to competition constraints from other rivals in the market and out of the market who intend to enter the market at any time.\nThere are many behaviors of producers to increase overhead cost. For example, why does a firm spend a lot of money on R&D (Research and Development) and innovation which increase cost? Because there are two functions for technology: one is to reduce production cost which is direct cost, so that producers can get higher profit (actually overhead cost) with the same price (income). The other is to improve the quality of products, so that consumers are willing to buy even with higher price. Thus the money invested in R&D is used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of technology.\nWhy does a firm pay high salary to employ an able executive? Because an able executive is either a cost-killer who can drastically cut cost (direct cost, or a marketing expert who can greatly increase the sales of products in the market. Thus the money paid to hire an able executive is also used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of human capital of the able executive.\nWhy does a firm spend a lot of money on advertisement to build brand? Because the essence of brand is to reduce the information cost of consumers on the quality of the products, so that consumers are willing to buy brand-name products even with higher price. Thus the money invested in building brand is also used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of brand.\nThirdly, overhead cost can protect producers from being knocked out of the market by competition, while market competition can in turn protect overhead cost. The income that producers can get from selling the whole business is the direct cost of those who are still outside the market and intend to enter. As long as there are outsiders who intend to enter the market at any time, one of their options is to directly purchase the whole business transferred by insiders. Therefore, these outsiders who compete to enter the market have objectively protected the overhead cost of insiders from falling to zero. Competition will dissipate profit, but will protect rent which is overhead cost. Precisely speaking, the competition among the outsiders to enter the market can protect the overhead cost of insiders which will in turn protect the insiders from being knocked out of the market. The direct cost of insiders is naturally lower than that of outsiders, so the insiders have the advantage of cost in the competition with outsiders.\nHow does market competition protect the overhead cost? There are two aspects. Suppose one has store, and per month the income is RMB12,000, the direct cost of water, electricity, labor, etc. is RMB2,000, so the overhead cost is RMB10,000 which is the rent of the whole business. Theoretically, once entering the market, one will not choose to shutdown unless the income falls to be lower than RMB2,000, as shown in Table 13-2.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Shutdown\n0\n10000\n-10000\n\n\nB：No Shutdown\n12,000－2,000\n0\n10000\n\n\n\n\nTable 13-2\n\n\nHowever, why does the income fall? The analysis in detail indicates two different possibilities.\nOne possibility is that the insider is poor in doing business, and the income is less than RMB 12,000 which is common for other insiders. Suppose his income is only RMB10,000, which causes his overhead cost to fall to RMB8,000. Theoretically, he will continue to do business in the market, because there is still overhead cost. As long as the income does not drop to be lower than RMB2,000 or the overhead cost does not drop to 0, it is the “pain” he can bear.\nReally? No! Outsiders will find it profitable to offer this insider a price of not less than RMB8,000 but not more than RMB10,000 to buy the whole business (the store). Suppose an outsider offer RMB9,000. Will the insider accept it? Yes! Because now his options become that shown in table 13-3:\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Shutdown\n9000\n8000\n1000\n\n\nB：No Shutdown\n10,000－2,000\n9000\n-1000\n\n\n\n\nTable 13-3\n\n\nAttention: now the income of “Shutdown” is no longer 0, because the insider can get RMB9,000 by selling the store to the outsider when he chooses to shutdown, which leads to an increase in the opportunity cost of “No Shutdown”, and he becomes inclined to choose to shut down. If the income of “Shutdown” is adjusted to 0 so as to be comparable with the data in table 13-2, it is shown in table 13-4. It is clear that the competition from outsiders has changed part of the overhead cost of the insider to direct cost, so the overhead cost have decreased, which makes the insider tend to choose to shut down.\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nCost\nRent\n\n\n\n\nA：Shutdown\n0\n-1000\n1000\n\n\nB：No Shutdown\n10,000－2,000－9,000\n0\n-1000\n\n\n\n\nTable 13-4\n\n\nWhat is more, the overhead cost of the insider has decreased, but after the outsider have entered the market by buying the store from the insider, the overhead cost of the store will rise back to RMB10,000 (＝12,000－2000). In other words, market competition has protected the overhead cost of the store from falling to RMB8,000 or even to the theoretical minimum of 0 caused by the poor performance of insider.\nThis numerical example clearly shows how the market competition protects overhead cost of the store from being lower than the normal level of the whole industry, and allocates resources to the most efficient producers by the survival of the fittest. For the insider, he has made the optimal choice by selling the store to the outsider, because he can get RMB9,000 which is more than RMB8,000 if he chooses to continue the business. For the whole industry, this insider with poor performance has been knocked out of the market by the outsider, and the resource of the store has been transferred from the less efficient insider to the more efficient outsider through price competition. It ensures the most effective use of the resource, and protects the overhead cost (i.e. the rent or the value) of the resource.\nIt is even clearer if we observe public companies in the stock market. If the performance of the CEO in a public company is so poor that the stock price drop dramatically, outsiders will buy the stocks in large quantities. When they can control the company, they will enter the board of directors and fire the incompetent CEO, thus protecting the equity (overhead cost) from falling to 0 or even going bankrupt.\nThe other possibility of income decline is that the business environment of the whole industry is worsening, which is not the problem of a certain producer’s poor performance. Suppose the income of all producers generally drops from RMB12,000 to RMB10,000, causing the overhead cost of insiders to drop from RMB10,000 to RMB8,000. Now there will be no outsiders who are attracted to enter the market, because they also expect to get only RMB10,000 instead of RMB12,000. For outsiders, all costs are direct costs which are RMB10,000, while the direct costs of insiders are only RMB2,000 which are much lower, so outsiders cannot compete with insiders. In other words, with the same other factors (such as the ability of doing business), the direct cost of insider is lower than outsider because outsider does not have overhead cost and all costs are direct costs. Thus insiders are protected by overhead cost and free from outsiders’ competition before the income falls to be lower than overhead cost.\nIn brief, the competition of outsider' entering the market protects the overhead cost of the assets held by insiders, which in turn protects insiders from the competition of outsiders. Of course, the premise of the protection is that insiders are not less competitive than outsiders. In other words, the competitiveness of an insider is precisely reflected in the overhead cost of the assets he holds. The more competitive he is, the higher the overhead cost of his assets, and the harder it is for outsiders to enter the market to compete with him and knock him out.\nWhat is more, the income decline of the whole industry may be due to other reasons except for the economic recession. For example, there may be technological progress or other factors that leads to the decline in production cost or transaction cost. There are also two possibilities.\nOne possibility is that new industry is emerging, which is a perfect substitute for the old industry, and more competitive than the old one. The old industry may be replaced or even completely eliminated by the new industry. The most typical example is digital camera replacing film camera. In fact, it is logically similar to an insider with poor performance is replaced by a more competitive outsider. Therefore, when the income of the old industry decline, market competition will not protect the overhead cost of it, but will protect the overhead cost of the whole economy! Market competition will replace the overhead cost of the old industry with that of the new industry to ensure that the overhead cost of the whole economy is protected. It is similar to the previous analysis of market competition which replaces the poor-performed insider (equivalent to the old industry) with the competent outsider (equivalent to the new industry) to protect the overhead cost of the store (equivalent to the whole economy).\nThe other possibility is that some factors (such as technological progress) lead to a drop in production cost or transaction cost which is the entry threshold of an industry, resulting in a drop in the cost of entry for outsiders. The entry threshold is part of the overhead cost of insiders, which is monopolistic rent, so the lower threshold will cause the overhead cost of insiders to fall.\nOne of the typical examples is the development of microfilm. In the past, movie-making required high technology and much capital, which means that the entry threshold of the movie industry was very high. However, the progress of Internet technology has given birth to microfilm, of which the requirement of technology and capital for making movie is much lower than before. Many directors are indignant, because they used to spend a lot of energy and money on movie-making, while young people now can easily make microfilm. They accuse the microfilm of being too low in threshold and chaotic. They had spent a lot of money when they entered the movie industry. The cost they had paid is historical cost, and has converted to overhead cost which is covered by the high price of their products (movies) due to the high entry threshold keeping outsiders away. Now young people can easily make microfilm, which means the entry threshold for outsiders has been greatly reduced, resulting in a significant drop in the overhead cost of senior directors.\nIt is profit dissipation caused by fiercer market competition, which seems somewhat similar to rent dissipation. Rent dissipation is due to infringement of PPRs, while profit dissipation is due to the factor change (such as technological progress) causing the monopolistic rent turn to profit which will be surely dissipated by market competition. When the entry threshold or monopoly of an industry declines and competition becomes fiercer, the overhead cost originally protected by the threshold will be turned to profit without protection and dissipated by competition.2\nNo matter what will the factor change cause, or no matter whether market competition protects the overhead cost of an industry or dissipates the profit (turned from previous overhead cost) of it, it must be good to the economy as a whole. Because even if the profit of insiders is dissipated, it is different from the rent dissipation due to infringement of PPRs, but benefits consumers through price reduction, which means the previous overhead cost of insiders is converted into consumer surplus, a concept to be introduced in the later lecture “Price-searching”. Thus, from the perspective of the whole economy, market competition does not dissipate overhead cost, but converts them into consumer surplus. Market competition still protects the rent of the whole economy in the way that the rent of the whole economy now is not in the form of producer surplus (overhead cost), but consumer surplus.\nFourthly, the size of overhead cost also affects the quality of product, which is determined by “the Principle of Rent Matching”. It is a theory with wide application and strong explanatory power, which will be introduced in detail in the next section.\n\n\n1. In MSE, the shutdown decision is analyzed with the wrong concepts of short-run, long-run and fixed cost. ↩\n\n\n2. The factor change (such as technological progress) leading to decrease entry threshold may be bad to insiders, but may also be good. A decline in monopoly in an industry will lead to an increase in the supply, then resulting in a decline in price, and demand will rise according to the law of demand. If the scale of the whole industry remains unchanged or just increases little, insiders must suffer from the decreasing overhead cost. However, if the demand rises dramatically, so the scale of the whole industry grows significantly, the income of insiders will increase instead. The development of automobile industry after China’s entry to the WTO is a typical example. Therefore, the factor change such as technological progress or liberalization of entry control which will lower the threshold or monopoly is not necessary to dissipate the overhead cost of insiders. The final effect depends on the change in the overhead cost of the whole industry. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture13/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture13/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Principle of Rent Matching","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Principle of Rent Matching\nThe principle of rent matching can be expressed by a Chinese saying “a good horse should be matched with a good saddle”. A good saddle is a saddle of high quality (rent), while a good horse is also a horse of high quality (rent). A horse of high rent should be matched with a saddle of high rent. Although the ancient Chinese did not know economics, they could discover this economic principle through a large number of observations of facts. They knew the fact, but did not know the reason.\nSo, what is the reason why a good horse should be matched with a good saddle? It can be understood from several perspectives.\nFirstly, the principle of rent matching is one of the implications of the law of demand.\nIf one has bought a high-grade residential land with picturesque scenery, he would not build a bunk house there. If he did, the construction cost could not be recovered when he sold the house, and only the price of the land could be recovered. A house built on a good residential land must be also good, which is the implication of the law of demand.\nA good residential land is a land of high rent, which must be matched with a house of high rent. Why? Suppose the price of a land is RMB10 million, while the construction cost of a bunkhouse if RMB1,000, which means that the price of land per unit construction cost for the bunkhouse is RMB10,000. However, if a luxurious house with a construction cost of RMB1 million is built on the land, the price of land per unit construction cost for it is RMB10. The law of demand says that when price (cost) falls, quantity demanded will rise. Therefore, self-interested people will choose to build a luxurious house of RMB1 million instead of a bunkhouse of RMB1,000.\nThere are other logically similar examples. In a community, those houses in the middle or other good locations are all large ones with high prices, while those that are small and with low prices are all located at the edge of the community or other poor location. The reason is the same. On the land with the highest rent in a community, developers will choose to build the houses of the best quality which not only refers to the quality of construction and design, but also includes the living quality with the least noise from the outside of the community. By contrast, on the land with the lowest rent, developers will build the houses of the worst quality.\nSecondly, the principle of rent matching can be understood from the perspective of recovering overhead cost.\nA reporter has interviewed a flowerpot seller at an auction for booths in Flower Market for Spring Festival, and asked what kind of flowerpot he would sell. He replied, “I don’t know until the auction is over. If the auction price is high, I will sell high-quality flowerpots, and vice versa.” This seller is just like ancient Chinese mentioned above who did not know economics, but he can discover this principle through experience that the flowerpots of high-quality (rent) should match the booth of high auction price (rent). But why? Because the rent of booth is overhead cost, and the high overhead cost needs the goods of high price to recover, and only the high-quality flowerpots can be sold at a high price.\nSuppose the rent of a booth is RMB1,000, if a bottle of water with the cost of RMB1 is sold, it must be priced RMB1,001 to cover all the cost (including the cost of water and the booth). Will anyone buy such expensive water? Obviously no! By contrast, if a diamond with the cost of RMB10,000 is sold, it must be priced RMB11,000 to cover all the cost. Will anyone buy such an expensive diamond? Of course yes!\nThe rent of production factors like shop is overhead cost that producers need to obtain income from the market as much as possible to recover. The higher the rent, the more they need to sell high-quality products of high price to recover.\nThere are other logically similar examples. It is high-quality goods that are sold in the prime locations. Luxury goods are always sold in luxury shops in the deluxe business circles of big cities, and will never be sold on stalls in the rural countries or the back lands.\nThirdly, the principle of rent matching can be also understood from the perspective of equal marginal principle.\nAccording to equal marginal principle, if a good horse matches a poor saddle, the marginal quality of the poor saddle will be higher due to the effect of the law of diminishing marginal returns which will be discussed in the later lecture “Market Structure: Price-taking”. Caution: the marginal quality of a poor saddle is high, but the total quality of it is low. Therefore, when the total quality of the saddle is improved, the marginal quality of it will decline, so that the marginal quality of the good horse and that of the saddle tend to be equal, closer to satisfying equal marginal principle, thus improving the overall quality of the horse with saddle. If the quality of the saddle is continually improved, the law of diminishing marginal returns will continue to work to make the marginal quality of the saddle continually decline, eventually fall to be the same as the marginal quality of the horse. Thus, equal marginal principle is satisfied, and the overall quality of the horse with saddle reaches the maximum. The quality can be regarded as rent, so the total rent of the horse with saddle reaches the maximum when the marginal rent of the saddle is equal to that of the horse. From this perspective, it is clear that to what extent the rent is optimal.\nIn management, there is a so-called theory of “Cask Principle” or “Cask Effect” which says just as the content of a cask slab, not the longest one, the competitiveness of a firm is determined by the weakest link, not the strongest one. Strictly speaking, it is not a theory at all, but a sum up of some similar phenomena, which is precisely an implication of the principle of rent matching from the perspective of equal marginal principle.\nThe principle of rent matching implies that it is more effective to improve the competitiveness of the weakest link of a firm than to improve that of the strongest one. Since the competitiveness of the weakest link is weak, the marginal competitiveness of it should be higher than that of other relatively stronger links. Therefore, according to equal marginal principle, if the competitiveness of the weakest link is improved to be equal to that of the other relatively stronger links, the overall competitiveness of the entire firm will be improved too. The competitiveness of the weakest link means the rent of it is low, while the competitiveness of strongest link means the rent is high. The combination of low rent and high rent is out of line with the principle of rent matching, so to improve the competitiveness of the weakest link is to increase the rent of it to match the high rent of the other relatively stronger links, which result in the rise of the total rent (overall competiveness) of the whole firm.\nSome may ask why not sell low-quality flowerpots in a high-rent booth to earn more income through smaller margins with greater volume so as to recover overhead cost? The answer is: it depends on whether the price elasticity of demand for low-quality flowerpots is elastic, which means a small fall in the price can bring about a substantial rise in quantity demanded, so the income finally increases. The problem of elasticity has been discussed in Lecture 8 that in economics, until now there are no reliable theories to infer the elasticity of a good in advance.\nThere is another similar but opposite question: why not sell high-quality products in a low-rent booth? Is it not easier to recover overhead cost than selling in a high-rent booth? The answer is: who dares to buy a high-priced product in a low-rented booth? For example, who dares to buy a diamond from stall? No one, because buyers will not believe it is a real diamond. The key constraint is information cost. Low-quality products are low-priced, and even if they are fakes, the buyers will not lose much money.\nIf there is no problem of information cost, such as the buyers and sellers in the school canteen are familiar with each other, so the information cost is almost reduced to 0, the poor-decorated canteen will also sell high-quality goods. Here, what matches the high-quality (high-rent) goods is actually the good-credit instead of the poor-decoration of the school canteen.\nThus, when the principle of rent matching principle is applied to explain phenomena, we should be careful. There are some phenomena that seem to have refuted this principle. For example, goods sold in tourist attractions are often expensive and of poor quality, as in service areas of expressways. The rent of these locations is high just because of administrative monopoly which is different from the monopoly caused by the market competition such as the prime locations in cities. Take the service area of expressways which is far away from residential districts as an example. The passengers have to buy food there, or else they will wonder how far to go before they can reach a residential district. By contrast, the prime locations in cities are easily subject to competitive pressure from the locations nearby. If the goods sold there are only high-priced without high-quality, consumers will leave there and choose to do shopping nearby.\nIn brief, if there is administrative monopoly, the effect of the principle of rent matching will be distorted. After all, this principle is based on the pressure of market competition.\n"},"Lecture13/Section05.html":{"url":"Lecture13/Section05.html","title":"Section 5: The Form of Contract Affects Overhead Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 5: The Form of Contract Affects Overhead Cost\nAs mentioned before, the calculation formula of overhead cost is “income－direct cost”. In the previous sections, only the change of overhead cost caused by the change (decline) of income has been analyzed. However, the factors that affect overhead cost are not only income, but also the form of contract which is regarded as the other unchanged factors before. In this section, income is regarded as the other unchanged factors, and the effect of different contract forms on overhead cost will be analyzed.\nWe will take the business of selling vegetables as an example to show that even if income is unchanged, the overhead cost under different contract forms will be very different. Although the business of selling vegetables is a commercial (trade) activity, the relevant analysis can be analogized to industrial production.\nSuppose one is thinking about the business of selling vegetables. After investigating the relevant income and cost, he finds that the retail price of vegetables in the market is RMB1, while the wholesale price 0.2RMB which is equivalent to the cost of raw materials in industrial production. He needs a carrying-pole to transport the vegetables to the market, and the rent of it is 0.2RMB a day which is equivalent to the cost of machines and equipments in industrial production. In the market, he has to rent a stall to sell the vegetables, and the rent of it is 0.3RMB a day which is equivalent to the cost of the factory buildings in industrial production. He also needs to hire a labor to sell the vegetables, and the wage is 0.2RMB a day which is equivalent to the labor cost in industrial production. The money he needs is borrowed from a bank, and the interest is 0.1RMB a day.\nBefore entering the market, all the costs have not been paid, so all the costs are direct costs. For simplicity, suppose one only sells one unit of vegetables a day. All the costs are RMB1, which are equal to the income (the price of the vegetables). Therefore, one decides to enter the market according to the zero-profit theorem.\nOne borrowed RMB1 from a bank, and paid the interest of 0.1RMB immediately, thus the interest cost became historical cost. And he hired a worker and paid him the wage of RMB0.2 a day immediately, thus the labor cost also became historical cost. He then instructed the worker to rent a carrying-pole, and paid the rent of RMB0.2 immediately, thus the rent of it became historical cost. The worker went to the wholesale market and spent RMB0.2 to buy a unit of vegetables, thus the cost of the vegetables also became historical cost. The worker transported the vegetables to the market with the carrying-pole, and rented a stall and paid the rent of RMB0.3, thus the rent of the stall also became historical cost. In this way, all expenditures (RMB1) are historical costs and there are not any direct costs. Therefore, as long as the market price of the vegetable is not 0, even if it is lower than the expectation of RMB1, one should accept the price, and all the income is overhead cost.\nHowever, one can obtain all these production factors in another way. When borrowing money from a bank, one agreed with the bank not to pay fixed interest, but to share the income with it, which is equivalent to the bank taking a stake in the capital and earning 10% of the income from selling vegetables, so he did not have to pay a fixed amount of interest immediately. Then he agreed with the worker that the wage was not a fixed amount but a share of 20% of the income from selling vegetables. When renting the carrying-pole, the rent was not a fixed mount, but a share of 20%. When buying the vegetables in the wholesale market, he agreed with the wholesaler that the price of the vegetables was a share of 20%. The worker carried the vegetables to the market, and leased the stall with a rent of a share of 30%. So far, one has not paid a cent, so there was no historical cost, and all is direct cost.\nIn other words, if all the production factors are obtained by sharecropping contract, all the costs is direct cost and there is no overhead cost. By contrast, if all the production factors are obtained by one-time buyout or fixed-rent contract, there is no direct cost and all the costs is overhead cost.\nIn reality, all kinds of production factors are usually obtained through a mixture of fixed-amount contract and sharecropping contract. Generally speaking, fixed-amount contract is mostly used for capital, vegetables and carrying-pole, while labor is usually paid with base salary (fixed salary) and commission or bonus (sharecropping wages), and location rent is often a combination of fixed rent and sharecropping rent.\nThe nature of the costs in fixed-amount contract is closer to overhead cost, while the cost in sharecropping contract must be direct cost. The nature of the former cannot be completely sure, because even if it is a fixed-amount contract, unless it is a one-time buyout, the longer the contract term, the closer it is to the nature of overhead cost, whereas it is closer to direct cost.\nFor example, the wage of hourly workers is closest to direct cost. The daily wage is overhead cost within one day and becomes direct cost beyond one day. By analogy, the weekly, monthly and annually pay is overhead cost within one week, one month and one year respectively, and becomes direct cost beyond one week, one month and one year respectively. Even if the term of a contract is long, if the contract is allowed to be terminated halfway, overhead cost can become direct cost. Of course, it depends on the compensation required to terminate the contract. If the compensation is rather high, which means that the transaction cost is high, it is closer to the nature of overhead cost. However, if income falls sharply, even if the transaction cost of legally terminating the contract is very high, producers still have the option of illegally breaking the contract.\nUsually, producers with higher overhead cost are more able to bear the decline in income than those with lower overhead cost. As mentioned before, the income from the market is the (total) cost. When income falls, the producers with lower overhead cost will leave the market earlier, because the decrease of income has exhausted overhead cost and cuts into direct cost, which means the producers are eliminated by competition. Those who have only direct cost and no overhead cost are called “marginal producers” because they are on the edge of the industry. As soon as the income falls, which cut into the direct cost, they have to leave the market immediately. However, if all the production factors are obtained by through sharecropping contract, although all the costs is direct cost which can fall along with the income, the decease of income will never cut into direct cost! In other words, those who obtain all the production factors through sharecropping contract and all the costs is direct cost are the most likely to survive in an economic recession.\nHowever cautious: if the production factors obtained through sharecropping contract can earn higher income elsewhere, they also have the option to terminate the sharecropping contract at any time, which will cause the producers to leave the market.\nFor example, suppose the daily wage is 20% of the income from selling vegetables, the worker can only earn RMB0.1 when the price of vegetable falls to RMB0.5. If he can find another job elsewhere with a daily wage of more than RMB0.1 (no matter it is a fixed wage or a sharecropping one), obviously he will choose to terminate the sharecropping contract and job-hops.\nIn other words, if the income decline is not due to the overall recession of the industry or economy, but only due to the poor performance of the boss, even if the sharecropping contract is used, the income distributed to the production factors will be lower than that they can earn elsewhere, so they will still choose to terminate the sharecropping contract, which causes the producer to be eliminated out of the market. The reason why they can earn higher income elsewhere is, of course, that the lower income here is simply due to the poor performance of the producer. Thus the function of “survival of the fittest” in the market competition will still work even with sharecropping contract.\nIn any case, since wages can be flexibly and automatically adjusted downwards along with income decline, there can be no unemployment in a world where all production factors are obtained through sharecropping contract. The boss will not fire the employees, but it is possible that the employees will fire the boss. Then why are all production factors not obtained through sharecropping contract? This is, of course, because the transaction cost of sharecropping contract under certain constraints are too high. In other words, that there is unemployment implies that there is transaction cost, which is the reason of unemployment. It will be discussed in detail in the later lecture about unemployment.\nIn a word, when the income (i.e. the cost) is unchanged, the structure of cost, which means how much overhead cost is and how much direct cost is, depends on the form of contract through which the production factors are obtained, and the transaction cost of legally or illegally terminating the contract. The next lecture on transaction cost will explain that the reason why there are different forms of contract is also due to the different transaction cost. Therefore, that how much is overhead cost depends not only on income, but also on the specific transaction cost under different constraints.\nThus, it is clear what the fundamental mistake of the theory of firm in MSE is. It is impossible to know the structure of cost without considering transaction cost. And if the structure of cost is not clear, it is impossible to infer even the most basic behavior of producers such as shutdown or not. Marshall used the concepts of short-run and long-run to avoid the fact that there is transaction cost in reality, which is a serious mistake.\n"},"Lecture14/":{"url":"Lecture14/","title":"Lecture 14: Transaction Cost","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 14: Transaction Cost\n"},"Lecture14/Section01.html":{"url":"Lecture14/Section01.html","title":"Section 1: Transaction Cost is Indispensable","keywords":"","body":"Section 1: Transaction Cost is Indispensable\nThe concept of transaction cost has been mentioned as early as Lecture 3, but it has not been formally explained until now. This concept is not easy, so although it is so indispensable, it is not suitable to formally introduce it as soon as it comes up. Because transaction cost is a kind of cost, it is more appropriate to introduce it after the concept of cost has been explained. In addition, this concept should be introduced before the lecture about monopoly, because it is impossible to understand various behaviors of a monopolist without the constraint of transaction costs. That is why this lecture about transaction cost is put after that of cost and before that of market structure.\nSome may think that the textbooks of MSE can only introduce the relatively simpler phenomena where there is no transaction cost. So it is a kind of step by step learning, and not a mistake. However, if the textbooks of MSE really only talks about the topics that do not involve transaction cost, there is very little to talk about. In fact, they again and again step into the field where the phenomena cannot be analyzed correctly without transaction cost.\nFor example, if transaction cost is not taken into account, it is impossible to explain the postulate of self-interest or rationality correctly. That one is self-interested or rational does not mean that he will not make mistakes. Under the constraint of information cost (which is a kind of transaction cost), a rational person may make a wrong choice. If transaction cost is not taken into account, it will seem that he is not rational by choosing to harm himself. That is why the MSE contradict itself by saying that self-interest or rationality is the postulate of economics and saying that there are irrational behaviors at the same time.\nIn addition, whether price criterion or non-price criteria should be used to determine the result of competition also depends on the constraint of transaction cost. That normative economics thinks there are inefficient behaviors stems from ignoring transaction cost. The concept of disequilibrium is also due to ignoring transaction cost. Government intervention in price (such as price control) does not result in shortage or surplus but the rise in transaction cost (rent dissipation is also a kind of transaction cost). The theory of firm can only be an engineering theory without considering transaction cost. Different forms of contract (caused by different transaction costs) lead to different structure of cost. All these topics cannot be analyzed correctly without transaction cost. Can they be excluded from the textbooks of MSE? If yes, what else is left?\nThe concept of transaction cost does be not easy, but it is so important to economics that is it indispensable, just as air to human. Avoiding it will only lead to many mistakes and contradictions in the textbooks of MSE.\n"},"Lecture14/Section02.html":{"url":"Lecture14/Section02.html","title":"Section 2: The History of Transaction Cost","keywords":"","body":"Section 2: The History of Transaction Cost\nWhat is transaction cost? For this complicated and difficult concept, it is necessary to know the history and follow the whole process of the invention and development of this concept.\nCoase was the first economist to invent this concept. He published an article entitled “the Nature of Firm” in 1937, and put forward the concept of “transaction cost”, which was one of his achievements in winning the 1991 Nobel Economics Prize.\nWhy did Coase invent the concept of transaction cost? He wanted to answer a question in that article: why are there firms? As mentioned at the beginning of Lecture 11, the traditional theory of firm only cares about the problem of input-output which is about how much output a certain input can produce, focusing on the technical characteristics of production, and does not care about the production organization or contract arrangement. In other words, it is essentially an engineering theory, not an economic one at all. No matter in principle or in practice, production does not necessarily have to be organized through firms. Producers can be self-employed individuals or firms. However, in reality, especially in modern society, a large number of productions do be organized through firms. So the question arises: why are there firms? The market can also organize productions. Why are some productions organized by firms?\nSome economists believe that teamwork is more efficient than individuals working independently, which is why firms are needed. However, teamwork or cooperative production can also be organized through the market. In reality, many self-employed individuals buy semi-finished products from upstream producers and process them into those closer to finished products, and then sell them to downstream producers for further processing until finished products can be directly sold to consumers. These individuals are linked to teamwork, but they are organized through the market instead of by the boss or manager in a firm. Of course, there is also much teamwork organized through firms. Thus the question remains: why are there firms? The market can also organize cooperative productions, so why are some of them organized by firms?\nCoase’s answer is: because there is cost for market to organize productions, which is transaction cost.\nCoase did not give a clear definition of transaction cost, but listed the cases where there is transaction cost.\nFor example, a self-employed individual must firstly buy inputs (production factors) before production, so he must find upstream producers who can provide the inputs to him. It will take time, energy and money which are all transaction costs (information costs). After finding the proper upstream producer, he has to bargain the price, quality, quantity, etc. and may need to sign a contract, which also take time, energy, and money. After the contract is signed, it needs to be executed. He must supervise whether the supplier delivers the goods on time with good quality and quantity in accordance with the terms of the contract, which also causes transaction cost. If the supplier breaks the contract, this individual producer has to negotiate with him. If the negotiation fails, he may have to go to the court and hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit, so the transaction cost will be even higher.\nAfter buying all inputs, this individual produces the outputs by himself. Now he needs to sell the outputs, which means he has to find sellers. He may depend on the distributors to sell his products to consumers indirectly, and there will be additional transaction cost. Even if the products are sold directly to consumers, there will also be all kinds of transaction cost in finding consumers, bargaining prices, quality and quantity with them, signing contracts, executing contracts, negotiating and even filing lawsuits when contracts are broken.\nThe market is the same as an ordinary commodity in that there is cost for using it. As Friedman said, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, so the market is neither free. In Coase’s view, it is the cost of using the market to conduct transactions, so he calls it transaction cost.\nCoase pointed out that the benefit of using firms to organize production is to avoid using the market and thus to avoid paying transaction cost. If the producers in upstream and downstream are just different departments in the same firm, the department in downstream does not need to spend time, energy and monetary to find the upstream producers who can provide inputs, but directly asks the department in upstream to provide inputs. Neither does it need to bargain the price, quality and quantity, but just needs to transport the inputs from the warehouse of the department in upstream to the workshop of the department in downstream according to the instruction of the boss or manager of the firm. And it does not need to sign any contract or even worry that the contract may be broken.\nOne more example. Suppose one works as a secretary in a firm. In principle, secretarial service can be bought through the market. Imagine that every day one goes to that firm to see what secretarial service the manager needs today, such as how many pages of documents to type or copy, how many cups of tea to serve to visitors, etc. For simplicity, suppose there is only the work of copying. One bargains with the manager to determine the pages of documents, the required quality of copying, the price for the copying service. It is the same as that the manager takes the documents to the copy shop and pay for the service. Now one is not an employee of the firm, but a self-employed individual who runs a copy shop that provides on-site service.\nObviously, it is too troublesome! Every day one goes to the firm without knowing if there is any need for copying, how many it needs, and when it needs, which are all information cost. He also needs to bargain with the manager about the quantity, quality and price of copying the documents, and may even sign a contract. That it is troublesome means there is very high transaction cost in economic terms.\nWhat is more, secretarial service is actually much more than copying, and includes typing, serving tear, and welcoming visitors. Does one need to bargain with the manager about the price and quality for each service, such as how hot the tea should be, how much water should be in a cup, how fast the tea should be served to the visitors, how one should smile when serving the tea ... The transaction cost of using the market is too high. Therefore, we seldom observe the phenomenon of trading secretarial services through the market. More generally, firms recruit secretaries in the labor market, roughly describe the work of secretary, and set a price according to the time (time wage). When one is hired as a secretary in a firm, he must obey the instructions of the manager, without bargaining! That is precisely why using firms can save transaction cost: because one can no longer be choosy and bargain as can be done in the market.\nIn other words, the market guides individuals to provide products or services through prices: only when they think the price is appropriate, will they provide goods. By contrast, in a firm, they are ordered to provide products or services through the instructions of the boss or manager: no matter they like it or not, as long as they are employees of the firm, they must obey the orders. It seems that transaction in the market is free, while the work in a firm is compulsory. However, there is still a market outside the firm. One is free to choose which firm he likes to work in. If he thinks that the salary the firm offers to him is not worth what he contributes by obeying the manager’s order, he can ask for a salary raise. If he cannot, he is free to quit and find another job. Similarly, if the manager thinks one’s performance is not worth his salary, he can ask for a pay cut. If he cannot, he is free to fire him and hire someone else.\nAs mentioned before, some economists think that teamwork or cooperative production is the cause of firm. In fact, if cooperative production is organized through the market, the transaction cost is generally very high.\nThere are two cases. One is the cooperative production along successive links in a chain, which needs to be closely linked in time. For example, every step in a production line can be organized through the market in principle, but the products need to move continuously from upstream to downstream in the production line like running water, so there is not much time for the individuals in each step to bargain.\nThe other case is that several production links need to cooperate simultaneously. For example, when shooting a film or a TV drama, the cooperation of scenery, lighting, clothing, photography, actors, etc. can be organized through the market in principle, but all need to be carried out at the same time, so they cannot bargain with each other.\nBecause there is transaction cost, when using the market, one has to go through the process of finding counterparties and bargaining the price, quality and other relevant contract terms, which is rather time-consuming for cooperative production. Therefore, all these production links are put into a firm, and cooperate by obeying the orders of the boss or manager.\n"},"Lecture14/Section03.html":{"url":"Lecture14/Section03.html","title":"Section 3: From the Special Transaction Cost to the General Transaction Cost — Methodology of Science (4): Ad Hoc Theory","keywords":"","body":"Section 3: From the Special Transaction Cost to the General Transaction Cost — Methodology of Science (4): Ad Hoc Theory\nThere is a problem in Coase’s explanation of the cause of firm by transaction cost of the market. Since using firms can avoid transaction cost of the market, why are all productions not organized through firms? Obviously, if there is only cost in using the market, the postulate of self-interest implies that all productions should be organized through firms, and the market should completely disappear. However, in reality, there is still market everywhere. Is it disequilibrium? As pointed out in lecture 7, the seemingly disequilibrium implies that there must be constraint overlooked.\nThe answer is obvious: there must be also cost for using firms! As mentioned in the previous section, firms instead of the market are used to organize productions, which means the boss or manager’s orders instead of the market price are used to guide the various production factors.\nAs pointed out in Lecture 6 about the cause of the Great Depression and Lecture 9 about the theory of supply and demand, as long as there is no problem with monetary policy, price is an indicator that transmits information about supply and demand, quality and so on to all parties in the society quickly and generally accurately. People do not need to know what the specific demand and supply are in the market, just adjust their behaviors along with the change in price. The behaviors of different people guided by price are all adjusted in the direction of reaching equilibrium. By contrast, within a firm, there is not price to guide the options of different production factors which only blindly obey the manager’s instructions. The manager can only roughly estimate based on internal information feedback and his experience, so the chance of making mistakes is higher than the price as the guideline.1\nWhat is more, as pointed out in Lecture 4, the market system is price criterion which is a kind of competition criterion. Thus the market is replaced with firms, which means the price criterion is replaced with non-price criterion, and it will lead to rent dissipation. What exactly causes rent dissipation in firms? Among all kinds of production factors, labor is very special. Labor is more effectively motivated by price than any manager's instructions in the world.\nNeoclassical economists are used to dividing production factors into two categories: labor and capital. In reality, there are hundreds of production factors, why are they divided into these two categories? Neoclassical economists may say because raw materials, machinery, equipment, land and factory buildings ... are all obtained with money, so they are classified as capital. However, labor is also obtained (rented) with money and why is it not a kind of capital? In fact, labor does be a kind of capital because it can be called human capital.\nThe reason is: influenced by Marshall, neoclassical economists like to use geometry as a mathematical tool, especially rectangular coordinate system. There are two axes for a rectangular coordinate system, so there are two variables needed. In consumer theory which is used to analyze product market, the two axes represent the quantity of two goods respectively. In the theory of firm, neoclassical economists similarly used two production factors to analyze factor market. However, just as the two goods in the product market only need to refer to good X and good Y, the two production factors in factor market do not need to be specifically designated as labor and capital, and only need to refer to factor X and factor Y.\nIn the traditional theory of firm which ignores transaction cost and the influence of organizational form or contractual arrangement on production, there is no essential difference between labor and other non-labor factors. However, if the influence of organizational form is taken into account, there will be significant difference between labor and non-labor, because human has his own will, and will not do what he is asked to do. A machine will automatically and consciously operate even without supervision. Human is different. Without supervision, one may try to shirk. Therefore, the boss must send another one to supervise him. But who supervises the supervisor?\nThere are two kinds of supervision, which is the same as a farmer driving a donkey. A carrot can be hung in front of the donkey to attract it to move forward, and a stick can be used to beat the donkey when it refuses to move forward. A carrot refers to award as incentive, while a stick refers to punishment. If it is a tractor rather than a donkey, obviously the farmer does not need carrot and stick. In other words, compared with non-labor factors, there is additional cost of carrot and stick for labor. If the production is not organized through firms, and the producer is a self-employed individual, naturally he does not need a carrot to motivate him or a stick to punish him, but the price of the market directly motivates and punishes him. Thus, only when there are two constraints (to use labor rather than non-labor in a firm rather in the market), there will be additional cost of carrot and stick.\nCoase called the cost of using labor in a firm as management cost. However, the cost of using the market is called transaction cost, while the cost of using firm is called management cost, which is the mistake of “ad hoc theory” in methodology of science.\nIn Lecture 2, the mistake of tautology has been introduced, which is a statement with empty contents, and is impossible to be refuted. Ad hoc theory is the other extreme, which is a statement with too many contents, and is too easy to be refuted as soon as the constraints change slightly.\nLet us take an example of natural science to illustrate. Suppose there are a mobile phone and a cup on the table. Both are stationary, because they are all subjected to a pair of forces with opposite directions and the same magnitude, and are in equilibrium. One is the force upward of the table supporting them, while the other is the force downward. What is the force downward? One can define it in this way: the force on the mobile phone is called “force of phone”, while that on the cup is called “force of cup”. This kind of definition is precisely a typical case of ad hoc theory. When the object to be explained changes from a mobile phone to a cup, the definition of “force of phone” is immediately refuted. Similarly, “force of cup” is also limited to only explaining a cup.\nIs it logically similar that Coase defined the cost of using the market as “transaction cost” and the cost of using firms as “management cost”? These two concepts with different names can only explain the cost of the market and that of firms respectively. Once the constraint changes from the market to firms or vice versa, these two concepts will be refuted immediately. In social science (economics), the problem of ad hoc theory is not so easy to be observed as in natural science.\nThere is no difference in essence between transaction cost and management cost, and a more general concept should be used to unify them, just as “force of phone” and “force of cup” are essentially the same force which is the gravity of the earth. Similarly, in economics, the transaction cost of using the market and the management cost of using firms are essentially the same cost which is transaction cost of using different forms to organize production. Self-interested human will compare the transaction costs of the different organizational forms. With the same production efficiency, human will choose the organizational form with the least transaction cost. It is just like in the market, with the same quality, a buyer will choose the good with the lowest price.\nThus, after Coase, the concept of transaction cost is expanded to include the cost of using firms or management cost.\nLet us continue to compare physics with economics. Newton’s concept of gravity is actually ad hoc theory to some extent, because it is only applicable to explain the force of the earth on objects. In fact, there is force of objects on the earth, which is too small relative to the force of the earth. According to Newton’s law of F＝ma, the influence of the force of objects on the earth’s motion (measured by acceleration) is insignificant. However, the mass of stars in space is no longer negligible with respect to the earth, and the concept of gravity should be further generalized to “universal gravitation” which is commonly among various objects.\nLogically similarly, the concept of transaction cost in economics also needs to be further generalized to a concept in broader sense. It is Steven. N. S. Cheung who further expands the concept of transaction cost. The market is a kind of institution, and a firm is also a kind of institution. Besides the market and firms, there are other organizational forms in the world, such as family, organization and nation.\nAs mentioned in Lecture 4, the transaction cost of using the market is not only the cost of finding upstream producers, bargaining price and quality, and so on, but also the cost of game rules supporting the price criterion (i.e. the cost of the legal system protecting PPRs). It is the same for non-market system. For example, there are rules and disciplines in a firm to support the order of the boss or manager, and moral customs in a society, laws and regulations in a nation, family rules in a family, and even in gangdom, there are so-called rules and regulations. Different organizational forms are actually carriers of different game rules or institutions. It is those different institutions that specifically define different organizational forms and apply different competition criteria. They not only organize productions, but also restrict all kinds of behaviors in competition. The use of different organizational forms is actually the use of different institutions, which is not free lunch, and there is different cost for the establishment, operation and maintenance of different institutions. Human choose between different institutions, just as they choose between different goods, and of course, they will choose the institution with the lowest cost.\nHowever, when the market is not used, there is no transaction, so the concept of transaction cost sounds misleading literally. Thus, the so-called transaction cost should be more generally called Institution Cost which is the cost of the establishment, operation and maintenance of institution. Because the concept of transaction cost initiated by Coase has become too popular, it can still refer to institution cost. So it is the compromise: the cost of using the market is the special transaction cost, while the cost of using different institutions is the general transaction cost which is institution cost.\nThus, the function of all kinds of institutions (including the market) is to decrease some kinds of transaction cost, but any institution will inevitably increase other kinds of transaction cost. A certain institution can survive only because the transaction cost it increases is lower than the transaction cost it decreases. For example, if human choose to use the market under a certain constraints, it must be because the transaction cost of using non-market (such as firms, planned economy, etc.) is higher. Although the market will also cause some kinds of transaction cost, it must be relatively lower than other kinds of transaction cost the market can decrease.\nOf course, the change in constraints will lead to the change in the transaction cost of different institutions, which may cause human to switch from one institution to another. It is similar to the change in the relative price of different goods, which may cause consumers to switch from one good to another. This is precisely institutional transformation.\nBy comparing the process of generalizing the concept from “gravity” to “universal gravitation” in physics with that of generalizing the concept from “special transaction cost” to “general transaction cost” (institution cost) in economics, we can not only better understand why the scope of transaction cost is continuously expanding, but also better understand how useful theories (i.e. scientifically truth) are constructed. Ad hoc theory is too easy to be refuted, while tautology is completely irrefutable. Therefore, although they are opposite in nature, the results are the same in that they are neither useful theories. Ad hoc theory and tautology are two extremes on a line, and the useful theories should be located between them by adding appropriate constraints.\nThere are two ways to construct a useful theory by moving to the middle from the two extremes. One way is to start from tautology and move toward ad hoc theory by adding constraints, which is the basic application of marginal analysis introduced in Lecture 7. A typical example is that the economics is constructed based on the postulate of self-interest (a tautology) with different constraints.\nThe other way is to start from ad hoc theory and move toward tautology by relaxing assumptions, which is called “generalization”. Here, the development of the concept of transaction cost is a typical example. Firstly, starting from the specific phenomenon of why there are firms, Coase put forward the concepts of transaction cost and management cost, which is ad hoc theory. Other economists followed up the development and gradually generalized to the concept of institution cost which can be used to explain all kinds of organizations.\nIn scientific methodology, there has always been a dispute between “deduction” and “induction”. In fact, they are only these two ways to construct useful theories. Start from tautology is based on unreal postulate, and seems to be purely logical deduction. However, if constraints as objective facts are not added, it will be unscientific because it is irrefutable. On the other hand, starting from ad hoc theory is based on objective facts (experiences), and the commonness (laws) of a large number of similar phenomena are sought to realize generalization. Both roads lead to Rome, and they are just applied to different phenomena.\n\n\n1. F. A. Hayek (1899-1992) was the first economist to expound the role of price in reducing the information cost for both suppliers and demanders, and in reaching equilibrium in his article “The Use of Knowledge in Society”. What he called “knowledge” is information mentioned in this book, so this article is probably the earliest study on information cost in economics, and even earlier than the concept of transaction cost put forward by Coase. ↩\n\n"},"Lecture14/Section04.html":{"url":"Lecture14/Section04.html","title":"Section 4: The Perspective of Contract","keywords":"","body":"Section 4: The Perspective of Contract\nSteven. N. S. Cheung generalized the concept of transaction cost to institution cost. However, in order to avoid being too general and becoming tautology without refutability, he advocated to observing transaction cost from a more specific perspective. Different organizational forms are carriers of different institutions, but what on earth are institutions? As mentioned in the previous section, they are the contracts in the market, the rules and disciplines in a firm, the moral customs in a society, the laws and regulations in a nation, the family rules in a family, and the rules and regulations in gangdom.\nIn fact, they are all contracts! It can be a written contract or a conventional consensus. The contracts signed between parties in the market are certainly those human are used to regarding as contracts, but the rules, disciplines, moral customs, laws and regulations seem to be far from contracts. When one is employed by a firm, he has signed not only a contract of employment, but also accepted the regulations and disciplines made by the firm which is a common contract accepted by all employers of the firm. There are also implicit common contracts (such as practice and national laws) in the market. In western ideology, national laws are “social contracts” signed between people and government. Moral custom is said to be a contract between human and God, because in western myth, the rainbow in the sky after rain is the sign of a contract between human and God.\nOf course, the latter two seem to be mandatory compared with the former two. In the market, one can choose not to trade and reject the other party’s contract, while in a firm, one can choose to resign and refuse the rules and disciplines of the firm. However, in a society or a nation, it seems difficult for one to choose not to follow the moral customs or abide by the law. In fact, there are always choices. One can choose to leave the nation he does not like, or live an independent life in a wild mountain region. Just the cost is too high, so most will not choose to do so. It is similar to the cost of suffering a loss or even losing the job if one rejects the other party’s contract in the market or of the firm. It is also similar to one’s obstinate refusal to buy anything because he thinks all goods in the market are too expensive and of poor quality, and then he may starve to death.\nFrom the perspective of contract, the different organizational forms or different institutional arrangements are actually different contractual arrangements, or specifically, different contractual terms. The contract terms which directly measures and sets price are based on price criterion without rent dissipation (a kind of transaction cost), are called price terms or income terms.\nHowever, the cost of measurement (also a kind of transaction cost) is not zero. When it is too high, human will choose to measure indirectly by other contract terms (use terms). Indirect measurement will make the measured person tend to perform the contract ostensibly, causing rent dissipation which is an inevitable result of non-price criteria. Thus, although the cost of indirect measurement is relatively lower, there will be relatively higher supervision cost (management cost or transaction costs). Human will trade-off between higher cost of direct measurement and higher supervision cost of indirect measurement, seeking the lowest total transaction cost of a combination of contract terms, which is similar for consumers to trade-off between different goods, seeking the lowest total cost of a combination of goods.\nThus, what Coase said about replacing the market with firms is actually replacing another combination of contracts (of product sales) with one combination of contracts (of factor purchase or lease). When human choose different institutions, they actually choose different contracts, and the institutional transformation is the change of contractual terms.\nUntil now, the concept of transaction cost (institution cost) can be introduced. Steven. N. S. Cheung put forward the most appropriate definition of transaction cost as the cost that does not exist in Robinson’s one-man world. He further defined “society” as a world with more than one person. Once there is more than one person, there will be competition between them due to the postulate of self-interest and the constraint of scarcity, and there will be institution cost (transaction cost) because the competition criteria need relevant institutions to support their establishments. In other words, transaction cost is the cost of coordinating the competitive relationship between people and is the cost of society.\nSome may ask, “Is the cost of pregnancy transaction cost?” or “Is the cost of a game that needs at least two players such as tennis transaction cost?” Of course not. It is possible for technology to make artificial embryo, sperm or ovum, and even make human single-breeding. It has been possible to simulate an opponent in playing games. Any problem that can be solved by natural science is not related to transaction cost. There are problems of transaction cost that cannot be solved by natural science in the world is precisely why economics or social science is needed besides natural science. The theory of firm with production function as the core in traditional economics does not take transaction cost into account, so is just an engineering theory in essence, not an economic theory at all. Similarly, economics without the concept of transaction cost cannot be real economics.\nBy the way, what is the relationship between transaction cost and the direct cost and overhead cost mentioned in the previous Lecture 13? There are both transaction cost belonging to direct cost and that belonging to overhead cost. After the establishment of an institution, the transaction cost incurred during the establishment has become historical cost and the recover of it should be treated as overhead cost. When the institution is operating and maintained, the relevant transaction cost is direct cost. For example, the commission paid to the intermediary of a transaction according to the price is a typical transaction cost belonging to direct cost, because the role of the intermediary is to assist the buyer and the seller to find each other and reach a transaction agreement, and what he earns is the transaction cost.\n"}}}
