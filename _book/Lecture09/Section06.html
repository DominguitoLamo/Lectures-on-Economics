<p>Although agricultural price supports and minimum wage laws both belong to price floors, their constraints are different, so their phenomena are also different. Government can force enterprises to pay high wages through minimum wage laws, but cannot force consumers to buy agricultural products at high prices. In order to implement agricultural price supports, government has to purchase all the agricultural products that are so expensive that no one will buy in the market. Imagine what would happen if this kind of government purchase were used in the labor market. Government does not enact minimum wage laws, but establishes state-owned enterprises to recruit workers with higher wages than those offered by private enterprises. Obviously, people will flock to apply for state-owned enterprises, which forces private enterprises to follow and raise the wages to the same level, or else they cannot recruit any workers.</p>
<p>There are two direct effects of agricultural price supports: firstly, government must pay for a large number of so-called &#x201C;surplus&#x201D; agricultural products; secondly, agricultural products in the market are extremely &#x201C;scarce&#x201D;, so the prices are extremely high. Government can solve the latter problem by supplying the agricultural products it buys at a high price to the market at a low price or for free. As a result, there are phenomena such as free lunch for students and food aid used as a diplomatic tool in the US.</p>
<p>By the way, is free lunch really free? Do not forget that government is not an enterprise, so it does not produce to earn income, and its income comes from taxes which are collected from taxpayers. The so-called free lunch provided by government is in fact indirectly paid by taxpayers.  Taxpayers are forced to pay no matter whether they have children in schools or not, no matter whether they are willing to pay for the lunch or not. If one pays directly for the lunch, he will assure the quality is good enough for the price they pay. He may be willing to choose better or worse (with lower price) quality than that of the free lunch. Now government has made a choice on his behalf. Is it possible that government cares more about his children and makes a better choice than he does? For the suppliers of the free lunch, if customers pay directly, the saying that &#x201C;customer is god&#x201D; is not an empty moral sermon, but the truth supported by money. However, if customers pay indirectly through government, it is government that is god. The suppliers only care about how to please government (strictly speaking, government officials), rather than how to provide the free lunch good and cheap to please customers.</p>

<p>READING MATERIAL: AGRICULTURAL PRICE SUPPORTS<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the 1930s the U.S. government has attempted to maintain &#x201C;parity&#x201D; prices for agricultural products. Parity means the relationship between agricultural and nonagricultural prices that obtained during the years 1910 and 1914, a period of farm prosperity. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, high parity price &#xFB02;oors were maintained by government purchases. A federal agency, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), would buy any otherwise unsold quantities of supported crops at the support level usually at 90% of the parity price.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;surpluses&#x201D; purchased by the CCC were mostly stored; the federal government hoped to sell them in years of small harvests. But the amount produced almost every year was greater than the amount consumers would purchase at the artificially high supported prices. By 1960 the CCC held in storage as much wheat as that year&#x2019;s entire crop.</p>
<p>To reduce the cost of holding such huge stores, Congress passed food stamp and school lunch programs subsidizing food prices for some consumers. A variety of &#x201C;supply management&#x201D; programs were introduced to reduce quantities produced. In addition, the price support levels were reduced. The table shows that, accordingly, in the 1960s government purchases were much smaller than in the previous decade.</p>

<p>Over the years, political support for the policy of buying surpluses has declined. Instead, a variety of other techniques for maintaining farm prices have been increasingly used, the details varying from commodity to commodity. Generally speaking, these restrict either the number of acres that can be planted or the amount of product that can be sold. Such methods of &#x201C;supply management&#x201D; have been supplemented by other programs aimed at maintaining farm incomes, among them direct payments to farmers for acres not planted or for crops not sold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Government forces enterprises to bear the economic burden of minimum wage laws, while it has to bear the economic burden of agricultural price supports by itself. Therefore, government has been trying to get out of this trap it accidentally fell into, but hardly succeeds. The following reading material of &#x201C;Agricultural Price Supports&#x201D; shows how the US government has struggled for decades: firstly to reduce the level of price supports, then to restrict farmers&#x2019; planting areas in an attempt to reduce agricultural outputs. However, under the stimulus that the supported prices are still higher than the equilibrium prices, farmers have also played the trick of going around the restrictions: when government forbids them to increase the planting areas, they will use all kinds of means to increase the outputs per unit area. Finally, the U.S. government has to directly limit the amount of agricultural products that farmers can sell at the high prices set by price supports.</p>
<p>In fact, for European and US governments, there are mainly two mountains that have overwhelmed their finances and plunged them into sovereign debt crisis, one of which is precisely the fiscal expenditures on agricultural price supports. The other one is social security on retirement pension, which will be analyzed later in this book.</p>
