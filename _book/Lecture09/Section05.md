# Section 5: Minimum Wage Laws Cause Unemployment

As seen in the last section, the actual effect of price control that sets a price ceiling is so terrible, and what about price floor that sets a minimum price? It may seem contradictory for government to implement price floor to forbid low price while it implements price control that is claimed to help the poor who cannot afford the high price at the same time. Again it is the poor who are used as an excuse by government to implement price floor, because the price floor is mostly common implemented in the labor market and agriculture products market where the suppliers are labors and farmers who have always been regarded as the poor. Thus, minimum wage laws and agricultural price supports are the most typical price floors.

Let us look at the analysis of MSE first. Fig.9-4 shows the consequence of price floor. The equilibrium price in the market is P*, but government imposes price floor to inflate it to P’’. At such a high price, buyers are reluctant to buy, so the quantity demanded is only Q<sub>d</sub>’’. However, sellers are very willing to supply, so the quantity supplied is as high as Q<sub>s</sub>’’. There is oversupply in the market, which is called “surplus”. As a result, only the quantity of Q<sub>d</sub>’’ can be sold out. In other words, the consequence of price floor is fewer sellers’ goods are sold out.

There is the same problem in this analysis of MSE as that for price control. The quantity demanded and supplied are both intentions, so the so-called “surplus” is not a fact which cannot be tested. Only based on specific constraints can be there meaningful economic analysis. Fortunately, price floor is generally only imposed in the labor market and agriculture products market, so let us analyze them one by one.

Minimum wage laws are generally analyzed in the part about factor markets in economic textbooks, but the relevant analysis actually applies the TSD here. If we specifically designate the variable of price as the wage rate, and the variable of quantity as the employment of labor force, we can easily change Fig.9-4 to Fig.9-5. It can be seen clearly in Fig.9-5 that when minimum wage laws set the minimum wage of W’ above the equilibrium wage of W*, there will be unemployment of L<sub>d</sub>L<sub>s</sub>. There are two sources for the unemployment of L<sub>d</sub>L<sub>s</sub>: one is that the rise in the wage rate causes the boss to dismiss the workers of L<sub>d</sub>L\*, which means the quantity demanded for labor falls; the other is that the rise in the wage rate causes those who did not work before also come out to look for jobs, which means the quantity supplied of labor rise, so increase the unemployment of L\*L<sub>s</sub>.

Yes, there is only one reason for unemployment: the wage rate is too high! It may sound hard to accept, but it is ruthless true. As long as the wage rate is low enough, a person with normal working ability can always have a job. He is unemployed just because he refused to accept the job that he thinks the wage is too low. 

Unemployment is generally regarded as an issue of macroeconomics, but it is necessary to do some basic analysis here. Firstly, the definition of unemployment is problematic. What is unemployment? In macroeconomics, there is no clear and testable definition of unemployment.  If those who do not have a job are unemployed, then a housewife who does not go out to work is unemployed, which is ridiculous. A rich kid needs not work and can still live well, so he idles around all day. Is he unemployed? Obviously, this kind of unemployment include housewives and idle rich kids is irrelevant with the macroeconomic problem government should care about.

Therefore, macroeconomists divide unemployment into voluntary one and involuntary one. Voluntary unemployment refers to the cases such as housewives and rich kids mentioned above, which is not a problem to solve, while involuntary unemployment is. However, again what is involuntary unemployment? Here is a job of working 24 hours a day with the wage of only RMB1. It is hard to imagine anyone would accept this job, but those who refuse it are “voluntarily” unemployed literally.
Again, macroeconomists are busy in revising the definition of involuntary unemployment as that the labor force cannot find a job at the wage level he is willing to accept. However, this definition is still problematic. Some says he is willing to accept a job with the wage of RMB100 trillion, and there cannot be such a high-paid job in this world. Is he involuntary unemployment? To define unemployment as voluntary or involuntary means to use psychological factors to explain the unemployment phenomenon, which is non-scientific as discussed in Lecture 8 of “the Law of Demand” about the prohibition of using psychological factors for explanation in economics. In other words, in macroeconomics there has been no scientific definition of unemployment.

However, if seen from the perspective of ordinary goods, it is not such a difficult problem. That a labor is unemployed is equivalent to that a good cannot be sold out. As long as it is somewhat useful, it is impossible to be unable to be sold out by cutting the price. Even scrap metal, old books and newspapers can be sold out at a price low enough. Thus, the price is too high relative to its use, which is the only reason why it cannot be sold out.

It is true for labor force. As can be seen from fig.9-5, the minimum wage of W’ is too high compared with the equilibrium wage of W*, which is the only reason for the unemployment of L<sub>d</sub>L<sub>s</sub>. If wage is allowed to drop to W*, on the one hand, the number of L\*L<sub>s</sub> will choose to withdraw from the labor market, which means they will become housewives or rich kids voluntarily unemployed. They are those who ask for relatively higher wage, so if the wage offered by the market cannot meet their requirements, they will rather choose not to work. Take a housewife as an example, she will choose to work as long as the wage she gets from the market is so high that she can afford to hire a nanny to take care of the children and do housework for her. It is logically similar to a rich kid. If the market pays him tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, why does he not come out to work? Just because generally the market will not offer him such a high wage, he chooses to be unemployed voluntarily.
On the other hand, employers will increase their quantity demanded of L<sub>d</sub>L\* for labor force. When the minimum wage is too high, employers will not employ these people because they are not worth the price. As pointed out earlier, the essence of price floor is trying to infringe buyer's right to income right, which is foreseen by buyers before the transaction, so buyers simply choose not to buy to avoid the infringement. So what is actually infringed is the right to transfer of sellers. Yes, government can impose a higher price, but it cannot force sellers to buy something that they think not worth that high price. As a result, the good with price floor cannot be sold out, which is precisely unemployment in the labor market. In other words, the essence of minimum wage law is an infringement of the right to transfer of the labor force, not allowing workers to rent out their labors at a price lower than the regulated minimum wage, and it actually deprives workers of their right to work!
The objective effect of government’s policy is once again contrary to its stated good purpose: the minimum wage laws claim to help the poor obtain higher incomes, but in fact make them unemployed and lose the meager incomes they could have obtained. The minimum wage laws claim to protect the interests of workers, but in fact infringe the PPRs of the labor ability which is the only asset a worker may have. Moreover, it is low-wage people who suffer most, because the minimum wage laws only have effective impact on those whose equilibrium wage rates are lower than the regulated rate. The following reading material “Do Minimum-Wage Laws Reduce Employment?” has listed the results of the relevant studies: from rich and large countries like the US, to poor countries like Kenya, to small countries like Singapore, all experiences show that minimum wage laws have reduced employment, and it is low-wage people who suffer most from unemployment caused by minimum wage laws. Faced with such eloquent facts, how can anyone doubt about the conclusion?

> Economists, at least up to recently, have believed that in most labor markets the evidence supports the competitive model. A minimum wage, set higher than the previous equilibrium level, would be expected to reduce employment among the affected low-wage groups. The table here indicates some of the results of a study by Donald Deere, Kevin M. Murphy, and Finis Welch dealing with minimum wage increases legislated in 1990 and 1991.

> The table shows that age-sex groups with the highest proportions of low-wage workers –most notably the 15–19 age groups – generally suffered the largest proportionate reductions in employment. This is exactly what the competitive model would predict. (A possible exception was women 65–69, but only a small percentage of this group was employed to begin with.) The investigators also found large employment drops across other demographic groups with high proportions of low-wage workers, among them African-Americans and persons of Mexican descent.

> As an interesting exception, however, a study by David Card and Alan Krueger obtained results in conflict with the competitive model.[^6] The competitive theory predicts that an increase in the New Jersey minimum wage would reduce employment of low-wage workers in New Jersey relative to the neighboring state of Pennsylvania, but if anything the opposite was found. [^7]

From this analysis we can again learn another philosophy: do not expect government to help you, it cannot not help you, but even harm you! Whether government is ignorant or impudent, the objective effect is that it cannot help you.

In fact, all macroeconomists (including Keynes) admit that the direct cause of unemployment is the too high wage. Various theories about unemployment theory in macroeconomics are just trying to explain why the wage is too high and why the market cannot reduce the wage. However, these macroeconomists are simply unwilling to face the reality that there are minimum wage laws and strong trade unions in western countries that block the wage to be adjusted downwards, thus directly nullifying the market’s function of equalizing the supply and demand with price change.  There are other complicated aspects of unemployment which will be explained in the later lecture.

There are still some key points that need to be discussed about minimum wage laws. Firstly, some argue that minimum wage laws will not cause unemployment. Suppose the enterprise need 100 persons for its operation without minimum wage laws. When a minimum wage law is imposed, according which no one’s wage can be less than what the minimum wage law stipulates, and the enterprise still need 100 persons to maintain its operation, so it has to employ all the labors as before, and no one will be fired.

It is so foolish to think so! There are many ways for enterprise to reduce the demand for labor, such as increasing labor intensity. During the financial tsunami of 2008, a reporter interviewed the security guard of a factory. He said the boss fired the cleaner and required him to undertake the cleaning job along with his original responsibility. Although he was not unemployed and got the same wage as before, he were responsible for two jobs, which was actually a disguised wage cut.  If there were no minimum wage laws, the cleaner would keep his job with a wage cut, and the security guard would also keep his workload unchanged with a wage cut. However, with minimum wage laws hindering the wage cut, the cleaner who had the lowest wage loses his job and the security guard increases his workload as a disguised wage cut. What’s more, why must the enterprise maintain its original scale of operation? It can downsize the operation, and so cut some jobs to avoid the increase of labor costs caused by minimum wage laws. In extreme cases, it can even go bankrupt and reduce the number of employment to zero!

Secondly, in reality, the immediate response of the enterprise affected by minimum wage laws is generally not to dismiss employees, but to reduce or even stop recruiting new employees, because it is more troublesome (i.e. higher transaction cost) for the former than the latter. In other words, it is not those who have jobs but those who are looking for jobs that bear the brunt of the impact of minimum wage laws, which means that graduates just leaving schools suffer most. Indeed, the unemployment rate of young people is relatively high. However, if the minimum wage continues to rise or the performance of economy becomes worse, the enterprise will increase labor intensity as a disguised wage cut as mentioned just now. Finally, some employees will be fired, and those who are least worth or whose equilibrium wages differ most from what minimum wage laws stipulate will be the first to be fired.

Thirdly, some will doubt if the market is free to determine the wage, those with the worst working ability may get so little income that they cannot make ends meet. What should we help them? It is similar to the worry that the poor cannot not afford to rent a house without rent control, so the answer is also similar. According to the analysis above, minimum wage laws cannot help those with the worst working ability to get higher wages, but only make them unemployed and have not any income at all. In contrast, as long as it is not interfered by government’s evil policies, with the minimum wage determined by the market, the poor is sure to be able to make ends meet, because the prices of a worker's products and his wage are related to each other. On the one hand, the later lecture on the income distribution will point out that a worker's wage is determined by the prices of his products instead of the boss who employs him. On the other hand, the wages of workers will in turn affect the prices of products. If the wages of workers are low, the prices of products will be low too, so the expenses needed by workers to make ends meet will fall. If the wages of workers are too low to make ends meet, there will not be enough purchasing power to support the prices of products. The rich will not consume a large amount of products used for living, and will not compete with the poor for these products, so it is the poor’s consumption that determined the prices of them. In other words, the prices will fall until the poor can afford to make ends meet. That is why the minimum wage determined by the market must be enough to make the poor survive.
