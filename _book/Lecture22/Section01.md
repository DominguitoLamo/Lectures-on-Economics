# Section 1: Financial Crisis cannot Destroy Real Wealth

In so-called macroeconomics, the short-term economic change is business cycle, while the long-term economic change is economic growth. However, both in fact refer to changes in national income or social wealth. If it increases, it is economic growth, while if it decreases, it is economic recession. There is no need to distinguish between short-term and long-term.

According to the discussions in Lecture 19 and Lecture21, if there were no wrong monetary policy, there would be no economic fluctuation or business cycle. As for economic recession that refers to a decline in output, it is possible to be caused by a rise in risk (transaction cost) that makes people take defensive measures of buying insurance that is not helpful to increasing future output. The decline in output can also be regarded as an increase in transaction cost.

Here are some macro events in reality that further illustrate what key factors determine economic performance (whether short-term or long-term).
Example I: the Southeast Asian financial crisis in 1997

In 1997, international speculators led by Soros first attacked Thailand’s currency, the Thai baht. Only fighting for a short time, the Thai government had given in and let the Thai baht depreciate sharply because of the exhaustion of foreign exchange reserves. The currency crisis in Thai baht quickly spread the other Southeast Asian countries that the export structures of them were similar to Thai. Their currencies were also attacked by international speculators one after another and forced to depreciate sharply. Even the Korean currency (won) was affected. In the end, the only national or regional currencies that survived this “catastrophe” were China’s RMB and Hong Kong’s dollar. This currency crisis also quickly turned into financial crisis, even economic crisis, and triggered political crisis in Indonesia.

During the crisis, the Southeast Asia countries suffered a great loss. The “East Asian miracle” was widely questioned. Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia had angrily accused Soros of sweeping away the economic wealth accumulated by Southeast Asian countries for decades overnight.

However, looking back this financial crisis in 1997 now, it can be concluded that the economic foundation of Southeast Asian has not been destroyed. Supported by the financial rescue from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Southeast Asian countries adopted the fundamental solution of cutting expenditure, reducing deficit instead of Keynes’s prescription. What is more, the export competitiveness of them has greatly increased due to the currency depreciations, so their exports soared. The increase in trade surplus not only made up for the original deficit in balance-of-payment, but also brought foreign exchange reserves back to the pre-crisis level quickly. As a result, the economies achieved a strong V-shaped rebound. The doubts about the “East Asian miracle” vanished and were not mentioned again. Compared with South America, East Asia still has experienced rapid economic growth.

It is agreed that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia of 1997 seemed to be menacing and catastrophic at that time, but quieted down quickly due to the correct policies. From the perspective of long history, it was only a small episode on the long journey of Southeast Asian economy, and did not change the general direction of economic growth in the region at all.

Why? The answer is simple. As has been pointed out in Lecture 19, the real wealth is from goods (including tangible products and intangible services), rather than money that measures the value of wealth and facilitates transactions. Financial crisis does destroy something that is the number on the accounting books and used to represent the value of real wealth. And the real wealth of buildings, machinery and equipments and skilled labor (the production capacity that can create more new wealth) does not disappear, but just the digital value on the accounting books has declined (depreciation). As long as the financial crisis has passed away and the financial system (fictitious economy) based on the real wealth (real economy) stabilizes in a new equilibrium, all kinds of wealth whose physical form is completely intact (only devalued) can exert the production capacity as usual and create more new wealth again. Moreover, because they become much cheaper (due to devaluation), there is much less production cost, so the products are much more competitive internationally than before.

Conclusion: The crisis of fictitious economy (financial system) actually cannot destroy the physical form of real wealth, but only makes it devalued. As long as the chaos caused by the crisis is eliminated, it will not have a long-term and fundamental effect on economic growth.

Extension: The subprime mortgage crisis of US in 2008 that caused a financial tsunami sweeping the whole world and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2009 were both originally financial crises that would not destroy the real wealth. However, because the defects of the financial or monetary system that caused the crisis have not really disappeared, the fictitious economy is still out of line with the real economy, and the financial storm has never really gone.

More extensions: Canada, which is geographically and economically close to the US, has not been seriously affected by the financial tsunami in 2008 because there are few “toxic assets” caused by subprime mortgages in the financial system of it. European countries such as Sweden, which are also geographically and economically close to the Eurozone, have not been seriously affected because they do not share the same currency of Euro. It is proved from the opposite side that as long as the fictitious economy is not out of line with the real economy, the financial crisis from abroad will only have short-term shock, instead of long-term and far-reaching impact on a country’s real economy.

In other words, business cycle is caused by the disconnection between the fictitious economy and the real economy, so government should try to make the virtual economy in line with the real economy.
