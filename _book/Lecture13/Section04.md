# Section 4: The Principle of Rent Matching

The principle of rent matching can be expressed by a Chinese saying “a good horse should be matched with a good saddle”. A good saddle is a saddle of high quality (rent), while a good horse is also a horse of high quality (rent). A horse of high rent should be matched with a saddle of high rent. Although the ancient Chinese did not know economics, they could discover this economic principle through a large number of observations of facts. They knew the fact, but did not know the reason.

So, what is the reason why a good horse should be matched with a good saddle? It can be understood from several perspectives.

Firstly, the principle of rent matching is one of the implications of the law of demand.

If one has bought a high-grade residential land with picturesque scenery, he would not build a bunk house there. If he did, the construction cost could not be recovered when he sold the house, and only the price of the land could be recovered. A house built on a good residential land must be also good, which is the implication of the law of demand.

A good residential land is a land of high rent, which must be matched with a house of high rent. Why? Suppose the price of a land is RMB10 million, while the construction cost of a bunkhouse if RMB1,000, which means that the price of land per unit construction cost for the bunkhouse is RMB10,000. However, if a luxurious house with a construction cost of RMB1 million is built on the land, the price of land per unit construction cost for it is RMB10. The law of demand says that when price (cost) falls, quantity demanded will rise. Therefore, self-interested people will choose to build a luxurious house of RMB1 million instead of a bunkhouse of RMB1,000.
There are other logically similar examples. In a community, those houses in the middle or other good locations are all large ones with high prices, while those that are small and with low prices are all located at the edge of the community or other poor location. The reason is the same. On the land with the highest rent in a community, developers will choose to build the houses of the best quality which not only refers to the quality of construction and design, but also includes the living quality with the least noise from the outside of the community. By contrast, on the land with the lowest rent, developers will build the houses of the worst quality.
Secondly, the principle of rent matching can be understood from the perspective of recovering overhead cost.

A reporter has interviewed a flowerpot seller at an auction for booths in Flower Market for Spring Festival, and asked what kind of flowerpot he would sell. He replied, “I don’t know until the auction is over. If the auction price is high, I will sell high-quality flowerpots, and vice versa.” This seller is just like ancient Chinese mentioned above who did not know economics, but he can discover this principle through experience that the flowerpots of high-quality (rent) should match the booth of high auction price (rent). But why? Because the rent of booth is overhead cost, and the high overhead cost needs the goods of high price to recover, and only the high-quality flowerpots can be sold at a high price.

Suppose the rent of a booth is RMB1,000, if a bottle of water with the cost of RMB1 is sold, it must be priced RMB1,001 to cover all the cost (including the cost of water and the booth). Will anyone buy such expensive water? Obviously no! By contrast, if a diamond with the cost of RMB10,000 is sold, it must be priced RMB11,000 to cover all the cost. Will anyone buy such an expensive diamond? Of course yes!

The rent of production factors like shop is overhead cost that producers need to obtain income from the market as much as possible to recover. The higher the rent, the more they need to sell high-quality products of high price to recover.
There are other logically similar examples. It is high-quality goods that are sold in the prime locations. Luxury goods are always sold in luxury shops in the deluxe business circles of big cities, and will never be sold on stalls in the rural countries or the back lands.

Thirdly, the principle of rent matching can be also understood from the perspective of equal marginal principle.

According to equal marginal principle, if a good horse matches a poor saddle, the marginal quality of the poor saddle will be higher due to the effect of the law of diminishing marginal returns which will be discussed in the later lecture “Market Structure: Price-taking”. Caution: the marginal quality of a poor saddle is high, but the total quality of it is low. Therefore, when the total quality of the saddle is improved, the marginal quality of it will decline, so that the marginal quality of the good horse and that of the saddle tend to be equal, closer to satisfying equal marginal principle, thus improving the overall quality of the horse with saddle. If the quality of the saddle is continually improved, the law of diminishing marginal returns will continue to work to make the marginal quality of the saddle continually decline, eventually fall to be the same as the marginal quality of the horse. Thus, equal marginal principle is satisfied, and the overall quality of the horse with saddle reaches the maximum. The quality can be regarded as rent, so the total rent of the horse with saddle reaches the maximum when the marginal rent of the saddle is equal to that of the horse. From this perspective, it is clear that to what extent the rent is optimal.

In management, there is a so-called theory of “Cask Principle” or “Cask Effect” which says just as the content of a cask slab, not the longest one, the competitiveness of a firm is determined by the weakest link, not the strongest one. Strictly speaking, it is not a theory at all, but a sum up of some similar phenomena, which is precisely an implication of the principle of rent matching from the perspective of equal marginal principle.

The principle of rent matching implies that it is more effective to improve the competitiveness of the weakest link of a firm than to improve that of the strongest one. Since the competitiveness of the weakest link is weak, the marginal competitiveness of it should be higher than that of other relatively stronger links. Therefore, according to equal marginal principle, if the competitiveness of the weakest link is improved to be equal to that of the other relatively stronger links, the overall competitiveness of the entire firm will be improved too. The competitiveness of the weakest link means the rent of it is low, while the competitiveness of strongest link means the rent is high. The combination of low rent and high rent is out of line with the principle of rent matching, so to improve the competitiveness of the weakest link is to increase the rent of it to match the high rent of the other relatively stronger links, which result in the rise of the total rent (overall competiveness) of the whole firm.

Some may ask why not sell low-quality flowerpots in a high-rent booth to earn more income through smaller margins with greater volume so as to recover overhead cost? The answer is: it depends on whether the price elasticity of demand for low-quality flowerpots is elastic, which means a small fall in the price can bring about a substantial rise in quantity demanded, so the income finally increases. The problem of elasticity has been discussed in Lecture 8 that in economics, until now there are no reliable theories to infer the elasticity of a good in advance.
There is another similar but opposite question: why not sell high-quality products in a low-rent booth? Is it not easier to recover overhead cost than selling in a high-rent booth? The answer is: who dares to buy a high-priced product in a low-rented booth? For example, who dares to buy a diamond from stall? No one, because buyers will not believe it is a real diamond. The key constraint is information cost. Low-quality products are low-priced, and even if they are fakes, the buyers will not lose much money.

If there is no problem of information cost, such as the buyers and sellers in the school canteen are familiar with each other, so the information cost is almost reduced to 0, the poor-decorated canteen will also sell high-quality goods. Here, what matches the high-quality (high-rent) goods is actually the good-credit instead of the poor-decoration of the school canteen.

Thus, when the principle of rent matching principle is applied to explain phenomena, we should be careful. There are some phenomena that seem to have refuted this principle. For example, goods sold in tourist attractions are often expensive and of poor quality, as in service areas of expressways. The rent of these locations is high just because of administrative monopoly which is different from the monopoly caused by the market competition such as the prime locations in cities. Take the service area of expressways which is far away from residential districts as an example. The passengers have to buy food there, or else they will wonder how far to go before they can reach a residential district. By contrast, the prime locations in cities are easily subject to competitive pressure from the locations nearby. If the goods sold there are only high-priced without high-quality, consumers will leave there and choose to do shopping nearby.

In brief, if there is administrative monopoly, the effect of the principle of rent matching will be distorted. After all, this principle is based on the pressure of market competition.
