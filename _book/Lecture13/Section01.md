# Section 1: The Fallacy of Fixed Cost

In MSE, it is said that cost is the sum of fixed cost and variable cost. The so-called “fixed cost” refers to the cost of fixed input that cannot be changed in short run, while “variable cost” refers to the cost of variable input. However, what is “short run”? It refers to the period when part of cost is fixed, which means there is fixed cost, while “long run” refers to the period when all costs are variable. There is obvious logical problem of circular reasoning in MSE about fixed cost. Economists cannot clearly say how short the short-run is, but that it is short-run if producers have not changed all the inputs, while fixed cost is defined based on the period is too short for the inputs to be changed, which is in fact a tautology.

What is more, there is also a fatal fallacy for the concept of fixed cost. Producers cannot change the fixed inputs in short run, which means they do not have the option of changing the fixed inputs in short run. However, as has stressed in the lecture of “the Concept of Cost”, there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Since there is no option of changing the fixed inputs, how can there be cost?

Essentially fixed cost is historical cost, which comes from the production factors called “fixed assets” in accounting that need to be purchased or rented before production. However, historical cost is not cost. Before these production factors are purchased or rented, there are costs for them. Once they have been purchased or rented and the relevant price or rent is paid, these expenditures become historical costs, and are not costs any longer.

It is the most serious fallacy in the theory of firm in MSE: on the one hand, at the very beginning, it is stressed that cost in economics is opportunity cost, not historical cost; on the other hand, when it is comes to cost function (and hence production function) later on, fixed cost which is essentially historical cost is put into the cost function, and it seems that the concept of opportunity cost is completely forgotten.[^1]

If we insist that cost is opportunity cost, not historical cost, what are the costs of the so-called fixed assets that have been purchased or rented before production? Obviously, the costs of these production factors after they have been purchased or rented should be the income given up if they are resold or sublet, which is an alternative to retaining these production factors.

Obviously, the costs of these production factors after they have been purchased or rented should be the income given up if they are resold or sublet, which is an alternative to retaining these production factors.

For example, when a machine breaks down and stops production for one hour, except that electricity can be saved, it seems that all other inputs cannot be changed, and belong to fixed input, the cost of which fixed cost. However, is it really impossible to change these inputs? In principle, the boss can immediately dismiss all workers, and resell or sublet other machines, equipments or even the buildings. Of course, it is crazy to do so for just one hour of production suspension. Yes, producers will not do so, but it is just that they do not choose to do so, not that they have no such options! There is no cost if there is no option, while there is cost if there is such an option which is not chosen.

Why is the option not chosen? Because it is too costly. It is very troublesome to dismiss all workers, resell or sublet other machines, equipments and buildings within one hour. And it is even more troublesome to buy or rent back all the necessary production factors again when production resumes in an hour. The description “to be troublesome” in daily use means “there is high transaction cost”. The benefit of paying such a high transaction cost is only to save the waste caused by these production factors which have been idling for one hour, which is not worth it.
However, if the production suspension lasts for one day, the boss will choose to dismiss temporary workers, because they are paid on a daily basis, and the transaction cost for dismissal and re-recruitment is very low. It is less costly compared with the alternative of paying their wages even they need not work.

When the production suspension lasts for a month, the transaction cost for dismissal and re-recruitment of workers employed on a monthly basis also becomes lower than the cost of keeping them. It is the same for the machines and equipments leased on a monthly basis.

Finally, if the boss plans to permanently shut down, there is no need to buy or rent back all the production factors again, and the transaction cost for resale or sublet machines, equipments and buildings also drops to a level worth being chosen.
The above example only shows the case of production reduction, and it is similar for the case of production increase. For example, a boss of restaurant will only employ part-time workers to help during the peak hours of meal time, and will not increase the area of the restaurant. It seems that labor is variable factor, while the area of the restaurant is fixed factor. But the reason is just that the transaction cost of changing the area of the restaurant is obviously higher than that of changing the employment of part-time workers.

If a restaurant continues to thrive, the boss is sure to expand the area. There has been a small porridge shop near my home. Because the porridge is very delicious and the price is rather cheap, it has become so popular with the residents nearby, that there are much more customers than the tables in the peak time of the morning, and many of them have to stand outside the shop to have porridge. At first the boss only rented one shop front, and then he rents another shop front beside it to increase the business area.

Thus, it is not that producers have no options, but there is transaction cost, which makes it more difficult for some production factors to change immediately along with the changes in output than others. The transaction cost is precisely the cost of choosing to change. If it is too high, producers will not choose to change.

It is Marshall who invented the concepts of short-run and long-run term in MSE. He actually felt that there was transaction cost of changing inputs, but he did not even know the correct concept of opportunity cost. There is no concept of transaction cost in economics until Coase discovered it almost 50 years later. So Marshall invented these two concepts to avoid using the concept of transaction cost to explain producers’ behaviors of choosing to change some inputs but choosing not to change other inputs. However, as mentioned earlier, there is logical problem of circular reasoning for these two concepts and fixed cost, and it is essentially a tautology that never really explains producers’ behaviors. What is more, the concept of fixed cost is essentially historical cost, which is out of line with the concept of opportunity cost.

[^1]: <div>Why is there such obvious inconsistency in MSE? The reason is that there had been the theory of the cost of production before the concept of opportunity cost. It is Marshall who came up with the theory about the cost of production, but there had not been the correct concept of opportunity cost in economics at that time, so the wrong concept of historical cost was still prevalent. Therefore, when Marshall thought about the cost of production, he still used the concept of historical cost, not opportunity cost at all.<br/>As pointed out in the previous two lectures, there are two mistakes in the theory of labor value: one is that labor is regarded as the only source of the value of a good, and the other is that historical cost (the labor input during the production) is cost. Marshall had realized the former mistake in the theory of labor value, and found that other factors besides labor also contribute to production and create value, so they should also have relevant income in return. However, he did not fully realize the latter mistake in the theory of labor value, and continued to bring this mistake into the theory about the cost of production.<br/>When opportunity cost has been accepted as the correct concept of cost in economics, economists should revise all the theories came up with before the concept of opportunity cost including the theory about the cost of production with the wrong concept of fixed cost. However, economists have not done so, which causes that there is such obvious inconsistency between the concept of opportunity cost and fixed cost in MSE. Now we are doing so to eliminate any concept or theory inconsistent with the concept of opportunity cost.</div>
