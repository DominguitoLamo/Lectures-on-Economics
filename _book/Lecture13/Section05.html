                                <h1 id="section-5-the-form-of-contract-affects-overhead-cost">Section 5: The Form of Contract Affects Overhead Cost</h1>
<p>As mentioned before, the calculation formula of overhead cost is &#x201C;income&#xFF0D;direct cost&#x201D;. In the previous sections, only the change of overhead cost caused by the change (decline) of income has been analyzed. However, the factors that affect overhead cost are not only income, but also the form of contract which is regarded as the other unchanged factors before. In this section, income is regarded as the other unchanged factors, and the effect of different contract forms on overhead cost will be analyzed.</p>
<p>We will take the business of selling vegetables as an example to show that even if income is unchanged, the overhead cost under different contract forms will be very different. Although the business of selling vegetables is a commercial (trade) activity, the relevant analysis can be analogized to industrial production.</p>
<p>Suppose one is thinking about the business of selling vegetables. After investigating the relevant income and cost, he finds that the retail price of vegetables in the market is RMB1, while the wholesale price 0.2RMB which is equivalent to the cost of raw materials in industrial production. He needs a carrying-pole to transport the vegetables to the market, and the rent of it is 0.2RMB a day which is equivalent to the cost of machines and equipments in industrial production. In the market, he has to rent a stall to sell the vegetables, and the rent of it is 0.3RMB a day which is equivalent to the cost of the factory buildings in industrial production. He also needs to hire a labor to sell the vegetables, and the wage is 0.2RMB a day which is equivalent to the labor cost in industrial production. The money he needs is borrowed from a bank, and the interest is 0.1RMB a day.</p>
<p>Before entering the market, all the costs have not been paid, so all the costs are direct costs. For simplicity, suppose one only sells one unit of vegetables a day. All the costs are RMB1, which are equal to the income (the price of the vegetables). Therefore, one decides to enter the market according to the zero-profit theorem.</p>
<p>One borrowed RMB1 from a bank, and paid the interest of 0.1RMB immediately, thus the interest cost became historical cost. And he hired a worker and paid him the wage of RMB0.2 a day immediately, thus the labor cost also became historical cost. He then instructed the worker to rent a carrying-pole, and paid the rent of RMB0.2 immediately, thus the rent of it became historical cost. The worker went to the wholesale market and spent RMB0.2 to buy a unit of vegetables, thus the cost of the vegetables also became historical cost. The worker transported the vegetables to the market with the carrying-pole, and rented a stall and paid the rent of RMB0.3, thus the rent of the stall also became historical cost. In this way, all expenditures (RMB1) are historical costs and there are not any direct costs. Therefore, as long as the market price of the vegetable is not 0, even if it is lower than the expectation of RMB1, one should accept the price, and all the income is overhead cost.</p>
<p>However, one can obtain all these production factors in another way. When borrowing money from a bank, one agreed with the bank not to pay fixed interest, but to share the income with it, which is equivalent to the bank taking a stake in the capital and earning 10% of the income from selling vegetables, so he did not have to pay a fixed amount of interest immediately. Then he agreed with the worker that the wage was not a fixed amount but a share of 20% of the income from selling vegetables. When renting the carrying-pole, the rent was not a fixed mount, but a share of 20%. When buying the vegetables in the wholesale market, he agreed with the wholesaler that the price of the vegetables was a share of 20%. The worker carried the vegetables to the market, and leased the stall with a rent of a share of 30%. So far, one has not paid a cent, so there was no historical cost, and all is direct cost.</p>
<p>In other words, if all the production factors are obtained by sharecropping contract, all the costs is direct cost and there is no overhead cost. By contrast, if all the production factors are obtained by one-time buyout or fixed-rent contract, there is no direct cost and all the costs is overhead cost.</p>
<p>In reality, all kinds of production factors are usually obtained through a mixture of fixed-amount contract and sharecropping contract. Generally speaking, fixed-amount contract is mostly used for capital, vegetables and carrying-pole, while labor is usually paid with base salary (fixed salary) and commission or bonus (sharecropping wages), and location rent is often a combination of fixed rent and sharecropping rent.</p>
<p>The nature of the costs in fixed-amount contract is closer to overhead cost, while the cost in sharecropping contract must be direct cost. The nature of the former cannot be completely sure, because even if it is a fixed-amount contract, unless it is a one-time buyout, the longer the contract term, the closer it is to the nature of overhead cost, whereas it is closer to direct cost.</p>
<p>For example, the wage of hourly workers is closest to direct cost. The daily wage is overhead cost within one day and becomes direct cost beyond one day. By analogy, the weekly, monthly and annually pay is overhead cost within one week, one month and one year respectively, and becomes direct cost beyond one week, one month and one year respectively. Even if the term of a contract is long, if the contract is allowed to be terminated halfway, overhead cost can become direct cost. Of course, it depends on the compensation required to terminate the contract. If the compensation is rather high, which means that the transaction cost is high, it is closer to the nature of overhead cost. However, if income falls sharply, even if the transaction cost of legally terminating the contract is very high, producers still have the option of illegally breaking the contract.</p>
<p>Usually, producers with higher overhead cost are more able to bear the decline in income than those with lower overhead cost. As mentioned before, the income from the market is the (total) cost. When income falls, the producers with lower overhead cost will leave the market earlier, because the decrease of income has exhausted overhead cost and cuts into direct cost, which means the producers are eliminated by competition. Those who have only direct cost and no overhead cost are called &#x201C;marginal producers&#x201D; because they are on the edge of the industry. As soon as the income falls, which cut into the direct cost, they have to leave the market immediately. However, if all the production factors are obtained by through sharecropping contract, although all the costs is direct cost which can fall along with the income, the decease of income will never cut into direct cost! In other words, those who obtain all the production factors through sharecropping contract and all the costs is direct cost are the most likely to survive in an economic recession.</p>
<p>However cautious: if the production factors obtained through sharecropping contract can earn higher income elsewhere, they also have the option to terminate the sharecropping contract at any time, which will cause the producers to leave the market.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the daily wage is 20% of the income from selling vegetables, the worker can only earn RMB0.1 when the price of vegetable falls to RMB0.5. If he can find another job elsewhere with a daily wage of more than RMB0.1 (no matter it is a fixed wage or a sharecropping one), obviously he will choose to terminate the sharecropping contract and job-hops.</p>
<p>In other words, if the income decline is not due to the overall recession of the industry or economy, but only due to the poor performance of the boss, even if the sharecropping contract is used, the income distributed to the production factors will be lower than that they can earn elsewhere, so they will still choose to terminate the sharecropping contract, which causes the producer to be eliminated out of the market. The reason why they can earn higher income elsewhere is, of course, that the lower income here is simply due to the poor performance of the producer. Thus the function of &#x201C;survival of the fittest&#x201D; in the market competition will still work even with sharecropping contract.</p>
<p>In any case, since wages can be flexibly and automatically adjusted downwards along with income decline, there can be no unemployment in a world where all production factors are obtained through sharecropping contract. The boss will not fire the employees, but it is possible that the employees will fire the boss. Then why are all production factors not obtained through sharecropping contract? This is, of course, because the transaction cost of sharecropping contract under certain constraints are too high. In other words, that there is unemployment implies that there is transaction cost, which is the reason of unemployment. It will be discussed in detail in the later lecture about unemployment.</p>
<p>In a word, when the income (i.e. the cost) is unchanged, the structure of cost, which means how much overhead cost is and how much direct cost is, depends on the form of contract through which the production factors are obtained, and the transaction cost of legally or illegally terminating the contract. The next lecture on transaction cost will explain that the reason why there are different forms of contract is also due to the different transaction cost. Therefore, that how much is overhead cost depends not only on income, but also on the specific transaction cost under different constraints.</p>
<p>Thus, it is clear what the fundamental mistake of the theory of firm in MSE is. It is impossible to know the structure of cost without considering transaction cost. And if the structure of cost is not clear, it is impossible to infer even the most basic behavior of producers such as shutdown or not. Marshall used the concepts of short-run and long-run to avoid the fact that there is transaction cost in reality, which is a serious mistake.</p>
