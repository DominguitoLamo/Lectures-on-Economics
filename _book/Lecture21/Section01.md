# Section 1: The Statistical Index of National Income: GDP

Before introducing and criticizing Keynes’s theory, we will first introduce the statistical index widely used to measure national income -- Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This statistical index is based on Keynes’s theory of national income determination, and although the theory is wrong, GDP has been widely used to measure national income in practice.

GDP is defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country or region in a given period of time (usually a quarter or a year). A detailed explanation of this definition is as follows.

(1) GDP is used to measure the national income in a given period of time, which means it is a flow. In Lecture 18, the distinction between flow and stock in statistics has been introduced. National income is the sum of the income of all within a country or region. Since income is a flow, national income is of course also a flow. The period for measuring this flow is usually one quarter or one year, so in financial reports there are usually the data of quarterly GDP or annual GDP.

(2) GDP is the market value, which means the monetary value of market transactions. It is the market value instead of quantity because different goods have different units of quantity. If the quantity is not multiplied by the monetary price, it cannot be summed up.

However, there will be some problems. Firstly, the monetary price is nominal with inflation, so the increase in GDP is not only due to the increase in the quantity of goods, but also includes the factor of price rise, and the price rise may be caused by various factors such as the improvement of quality, changes in supply and demand, inflation, etc.

Therefore, GDP is also divided into nominal GDP and real GDP. The former is calculated by multiplying the current output by the current price of goods, while the latter is calculated by multiplying the current output by the base price of goods. For example, if 1978 is taken as the base period, the nominal GDP in 2011 is calculated by multiplying the price in 2011 by the output also in 2011, while the real GDP is calculated by multiplying the price in 1978 by the output in 2011, which can eliminate the impact of the price rise from 1978 to 2011. The GDP of China is nominal one, but the growth rate of GDP is real one.

Just as there are many problems with CPI (a statistical index for measuring inflation), so are real GDP. The general rise in prices caused by the general improvement in quality will be wrongly regarded as inflation, and these two indexes cannot handle the emergence of new products.

Secondly, if a good or service is not transacted through the market, GDP cannot measure the value of it. The most typical example is household service. If a wife chooses not to work and stays at home to take care of her husband and children, the GDP of the service she provides for the family cannot be measured. However, if she chooses to work and hires a nanny to do housework and take care of her children, the nanny provides the same service as the housewife in the previous case, but the service is transacted through the market, so GDP can measure the value of it. Thus, there is the same household service in these two cases, but the GDP in the latter will is higher than that in the former.

Besides, illegal and black market transactions can neither be measured by GDP. There are huge gray economies in many developing countries, so the data of GDP must be underestimated.

(3) GDP measures the value of final goods. There are intermediate products in the process of production, but GDP does not measure the value of them, otherwise there will be the problem of double calculation.

For example, the price of a piece of bread is RMB1, and there are intermediate products of wheat and flour. Suppose the value the wheat needed in the production of this piece of bread is RMB0.5, and that of flour is RMB0.7. GDP only include the value of the final bread (RMB1), instead of the sum of the value of bread, wheat, and flour. Because the value of flour (RMB0.7) has included that of wheat (RMB0.5), while the value of bread (RMB1) has included that of flour, if GDP include the value of the intermediate products, there will be three times of the value of wheat and twice of the value of flour. Of course, some flour is bought by the final consumers as flavoring, they are final products instead of intermediate products, and should be included in GDP.

(4) GDP measures the value of finished products instead of products sold out. GDP is a flow for a quarter or a year, so some products have not been sold out, which means they are inventory, and should be measured in GDP. If some goods were produced in the previous quarter or year, but sold out in this quarter or year, they cannot be measured in the GDP of this quarter or year.

What is more, the value of newly-built houses should be measured in GDP, but that of second-hand houses should not, while the transaction costs such as commissions paid for the transactions of second-hand house should be measured because it is the services provided in this quarter or this year.

(5) Both products and services should be measured in GDP. Products are tangible goods, while services are intangible goods, and both are valuable. The statistical index “aggregate social product” used to measure national income in China before is based on the “system of material product balances” established by Marx’s economics. As the name implies, this system only measures “material products”, not including intangible services. There had been a joke: For a train, the transportation cost of goods is measured as national income, but that of human is not.

For the statistical practice in reality, there are three approaches for measuring GDP: expenditure approach, income approach and production approach. In theory, these three approaches should get the same data, but there are inevitably statistical errors. The expenditure approach is based on Keynes’s theory of national income determination, so it is the basic approach among the three, and the data of GDP released by government is also based on it. Here, only this approach is introduced.

The formula of GDP by the expenditure approach is: GDP＝C＋I＋G＋(X－M)

“C” refers to residents’ consumption expenditure, including expenditure on various durable and non-durable consumer goods and services, but excluding that on housing construction that is included in I (investment).

“I” refers to the investment expenditure of enterprises. The term of “investment” here is not the general concept mentioned in Lecture 18, but refers specifically to the behavior of an enterprise investing money into doing business. Moreover, it only includes the fixed-asset investment and inventory investment. As mentioned earlier, if the products have not been sold out during the accounting period, they are in the form of inventory and should be measured in the current GDP.  From another perspective, investment can also be divided into net investment and replacement investment that is used to make up for depreciation.

“G” refers to government purchase including all levels of government spending on products and services. Attention: it does not include government’s Transfer Payment that is the government’s expenditure on social welfare, social insurance, unemployment relief, poverty subsidies, aged security, health care, subsidies for agriculture and other industries, etc. Transfer payment is only the unilateral monetary expenditure and does not exchange for products or services. The “expenditure approach” measures national output or income from the perspective of expenditure (the price of a good is income for sellers, but expenditure for buyers). If the expenditure does not exchange for corresponding output, it should not be measured. In other words, transfer payment does not increase a country’s income or wealth, but only redistributes income or wealth.

“X－M” is the net export because X refers to export and M refers to import. Export is the good produced domestically but consumed by foreigners, so it should be measured in GDP. By contrast, import is the good produced by foreigners but consumed domestically. This part of consumption has been measured in C, but it is not actually domestic product, so it should be deducted here.


In a word, C is the expenditure of individuals or households, I is that of enterprises, G is that of government, and X－M is the net expenditure of foreigners on domestic products. The expenditures of the above four sectors have purchased all the products in an economy. Financial reports often talk about the three carriages driving economic growth, which refer to the expenditures of consumption, investment and net exports, because these expenditures are determined by the market and can objectively reflect a country’s productivity and competitiveness.

By the way, from the above introduction of GDP, it can be concluded that national income is the same as national output, because the output will become income after sale.
