<p>From now on, we will introduce and criticize Keynes&#x2019;s theory of national income determination in detail.</p>
<p>The formula of GDP is based on Keynes&#x2019;s theory of national income determination that is a model of four-sector economy. For the sake of simplicity, we will first introduce the simple model of two-sector economy that there are only the sectors of households and enterprises without the sectors of government and foreign trade.
What is more, GDP measures the actual national income, which means it is about the historical data after production and consumption. By contrast, the theory of national income determination analyzes the equilibrium national income that refers to the national income when the planned aggregate demand and aggregate supply are equal before production and consumption. In other words, the former is a fact and the latter is an intention, similar to the difference between the trading volume (quantity purchased and sales volume) and the equilibrium quantity (quantity demanded and quantity supplied) in the theory of supply and demand.
The Aggregate Expenditure or aggregate demand of the two-sector economy is E&#xFF1D;c&#xFF0B;i where E refers to aggregate expenditure. Keynes proposes the consumption function c&#xFF1D;c(y)<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> that is supposed to be a linear function c&#xFF1D;a&#xFF0B;by for simplicity. Here &#x201C;a&#x201D; refers to autonomous consumption that has no relationship with national income (y), because even if one does not have any income, he still has some consumption expenditures such as food to survive. And &#x201C;by&#x201D; refers to induced consumption that increases along with the increase in &#x201C;y&#x201D;. Keynes calls b &#x201C;Marginal Propensity to Consume&#x201D; (MPC), and the definition formula is $MPC = \frac{dc}{dy}$, so it is the coefficient of &#x201C;b&#x201D; in the above linear consumption function. The value range of MPC is between 0 and 1, which implies that as income increases, one will increase consumption, but the growth rate of consumption is lower than that of income, because he will not spend all the increased income to increase consumption, but will only spend some of it and save the rest.</p>
<p>As for investment (i), Keynes believes that it is decided by enterprises and has no relationship with &#x201C;y&#x201D;, so it is a constant.</p>
<p>The aggregate income or aggregate output of the two-sector economy is y&#xFF1D;c&#xFF0B;s, because the income obtained from the goods after sale is either spent or saved. When all planned outputs are purchased by planned expenditures, the product market will be in equilibrium: E&#xFF1D;y or c&#xFF0B;i&#xFF1D;c&#xFF0B;s, arranged as i&#xFF1D;s. Thus, national income is in equilibrium when the planned investment is equal to the planned saving.</p>
<p>Attention: in reality, all investments come from savings, so the actual investment must be equal to the actual saving, which is logically similar to the fact that the quantity purchased must be equal to the sales volume. However, Keynes argues that here &#x201C;i&#x201D; refers to planned investment and &#x201C;s&#x201D; refers to planned saving, and both are intentions, so they are not necessarily equal, and are only so when national income is in equilibrium.</p>
<p>However, there are problems in Keynes&#x2019;s argument. (1) Intention is not a fact, so how is this argument tested? In order to test it, there must be some objective facts induced from the intention that is tested indirectly by observing these facts. Keynes has not said anything about how to test the intended investment and saving. (2) As mentioned in Lecture 7, unless against the postulation of self-interest, the world is always in equilibrium. If there were disequilibrium, in the analysis there must be some constraints that have been ignored. (3) As mentioned in Lecture 18, there is no difference between saving and investment. The remaining part of the present income after deducted the consumption is &#x201C;saving&#x201D;, while the remaining part of the present income that is not consumed now but left for future consumption is &#x201C;investment&#x201D;. They are the same, and just the former is from the perspective of present, while the latter is form the perspective of future.</p>
<p>What is more, Keynes regards consumption as the behavior of increasing national income (aggregate expenditure or aggregate demand), but saving as that of reducing national income, thus putting forward the so-called &#x201C;Paradox of thrift&#x201D;. The behavior of reducing consumption or increasing saving will reduce national income and cause economic recession, so it is evil. By the contrast, the behavior of increasing consumption or reducing saving will increase national income and bring about economic boom, so it is good.</p>
<p>Keynes also points out that MPC is less than 1, which means one&#x2019;s income obtained from production will not be all spent but some of it will be saved. He also put forward the psychological &#x201C;Law of Diminishing Marginal Propensity to Consume&#x201D;, which means as income increases, one&#x2019;s consumption will increase less and less, or he will save more and more. Without government interference, aggregate expenditure (aggregate demand) will be less than aggregate output (aggregate supply), which implies overproduction, resulting in economic recession.</p>
<p>However, saving is not different from investment. Moreover, now one usually deposits money in banks, and banks will lend the money to others in consumption (such as buying a car with mortgage loans) or in investment (such as borrowing money for an enterprise&#x2019;s operation), so how can aggregate demand or expenditure (consumption and investment) of a society decrease due to the rise in saving?</p>
<p>What if one keeps the money at home instead of depositing it in banks? Keynes puts forward the &#x201C;liquidity preference&#x201D; that argues that people are willing to hold cash instead of other non-cash assets because cash has liquidity that are preferred. He further argues that liquidity preference implies insufficient consumption and investment.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Lecture 19, banks usually lend out the money saved by depositors, but if they are extremely pessimistic about the economic prospect, they will be reluctant to lend. Even if one does not keep the money at home, banks also keep it in the warehouse and do not lend it out, so the money will not turn into consumption or investment of others. The investment seems to be less than and different from saving in this case, and excess savings seem to reduce aggregate demand. However, cash is only money, not goods. The goods or resources it can exchange for are not kept from production. From the perspective real goods, the investment of the whole society has not decreased.</p>
<p>According to the monetary theory, the above behavior of hoarding money will lead to the leakage of monetary base from the banking system and the decrease of deposit money created by commercial banks. As a result, the effective money supply in the economy will decrease, which will cause deflation. In other words, if people keep the money at home or banks are reluctant to lend out the deposits, there may be economic recession, but the reason is not that the decrease in consumption and the increase in saving will cause reduction in national income, but that money illusion caused by the unstable value of money misleads people to make wrong decisions. Under deflation, producers observe the price fall and think their products are not popular in the market, so they choose to reduce production, resulting in economic decline.</p>
<p>There is a story in the South Korean TV drama &#x201C;Uprising&#x201D; that should be based on the real historic event. The rich in ancient Korea liked to bury the copper coins in their backyards, resulting in serious &#x201C;money shortage&#x201D; (the ancient term of deflation). The hero of this TV drama was the richest in ancient Korea, and borrowed money from the rich, so that they dig out the copper coins and give to him, and then he lent the money to those who needed it. Since he was the richest, the rich all believed that he could repay the loans, and were willing to lend the money to him at a lower interest rate. He loaned the money out at a higher interest rate and earned a profit from the difference. With more money flowing into economy, it was easier for those who borrowed money from the hero to succeed in doing business, so they could repay the money that was returned to the rich through the hero, and the rich became more willing to lend the money to the hero... In such a virtuous circle, the hero successfully solved the problem of &#x201C;money shortage&#x201D;. Obviously, the hero in ancient Korea of this TV drama had played the role of commercial banks in modern society.</p>
<p>There is another solution that the central bank can issue more money to offset the decrease in effective money supply caused by the behavior of hoarding money. The monetary system pegging money to the price index of a basket of tradable goods introduced in Lecture 19 can monitor in time and accurately adjust the money supply to eliminate any inflation or deflation.</p>
<p>And what if one hoards real goods instead of money? As the saying goes, &#x201C;save for a rainy day&#x201D;, one hoards grains against the famine, and the grains are neither consumed nor sown in the fields. Will this behavior of hoarding grains or saving result in aggregate demand (consumption and investment) less than aggregate supply (aggregate output)? The answer is NO! This so-called saving is actually consumption, just what not the consumption of the use value of grains to fill one&#x2019;s stomach, but that of the insurance that there are enough grains to fill one&#x2019;s stomach in case of famine. In other words, what is bought by hoarding grains is insurance.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is the consumption expenditure caused by transaction cost. Only when there is risk (measured by information cost), people need to buy insurance against risks. If there were no risk of famine, all grains would be used as food in consumption or as seeds in investment (production) and the future output would be higher. When the risk rises sharply due to some reasons, people will spend a large amount of current income to buy insurance that is also a kind of consumption expenditure, thus greatly reducing investment expenditure and causing future output to fall which implies an economic recession (negative output growth). There is no difference from the case that one changes the consumption pattern for some reason, from thrift to extravagance (perhaps because he knows that he is terminally ill and will soon die), so he spends all income on consumption expenditure, without savings turned into investment expenditure, which causes his future income to fall. Obviously, in both cases, the saving decreases rather than increases, which proves the true cause of the reduction in national income is not that the increase in saving will lead to aggregate demand less than aggregate supply, but that the proportion of income allocated to saving is reduced, thus reducing the investment that is the same as saving, resulting in a decline in future output.</p>
<p>In fact, some consumption or investment expenditure may be not helpful or even harmful to the increase in future output, causing the growth rate of output to slow down or even become negative. As mentioned in Lecture 12, consumption can be regarded as a behavior to produce labor as a production factor. And as mentioned in Lecture 18, consumption is also investment, only from different perspectives. Not all consumption or investment expenditures will increase the future output. Among them, the most typical example is the consumption of drug abuse that harms one&#x2019;s physical and mental health. If there are many who have addicted to drugs in a country, such as the case of China in late Qing Dynasty, the economy is sure to decline. Obviously, this economic recession does not caused by the increase in saving resulting in aggregate demand less than aggregate supply.</p>
<p>Similarly, some investment expenditures are not helpful or even harmful to the future output. As mentioned in Lecture 19, different assets have different liquidity. The illiquid assets can also attract investors because they have better profitability as compensation. If investors are very pessimistic about the future, which means the risk increases, the profitability after deducting risk premium will decrease, so few are willing to invest in illiquid assets. Such illiquid assets are actually more helpful to increasing the future output than the liquid assets. For example, cash is the most liquid, but if one only holds cash and does not use it to buy goods or other assets, there will be no profitability at all, so it will not lead to any increase in the future output. Obviously, with higher risk, one would rather abandon the illiquid assets with better profitability, which is a reduction in investment expenditure and actually an increase in consumption expenditure of buying insurance.</p>
<p>In other word, such investment that is not helpful to increasing the future output is in essence the consumption that is not helpful to the future output. Not just drug abuse is unhelpful to increasing the future output, as does insurance, but the cause is that there is transaction cost. Unless the transaction cost can be effectively reduced, people will still choose to buy insurance, which is precisely the correct explanation for liquidity preference. Keynes made mistake because he did not know the concept of transaction cost, which has again proved that ignoring the transaction cost is the causes of many mistakes in MSE.</p>
<p>There is another kind of investment that seems to be not helpful to the future output: the expenditure on jade, artwork, etc. that can be collectively referred to as collection. The non-monetary value of enjoyment of collection is consumption expenditure, while extra value above consumption is investment (saving). Collection is not helpful to increasing the future output, and will it lead to economic recession? The answer is NO! Collection is a store of wealth, which is logically similar to the function of money as a store of value. As has been analyzed earlier, the behavior of hoarding money will not reduce the quantity of goods in the real economy, so similarly collection is not money, and storing it will not even cause a decrease in money supply. There is not much difference to store wealth in collection and to deposit money in banks. What is the difference between those who sell out collection to spend or invest and banks that lend out the money to those who need it to spend or invest?</p>
<p>To sum up, saving is not different from investment, so aggregate demand cannot be less than aggregate supply. There are two causes for economic recession (negative growth of output). One is the wrong monetary policy misleading people. The other is the rising transaction cost (risk) that makes people spend more income on buying insurance that is actually a kind of consumption expenditure unhelpful to increasing the future output. In other words, besides the wrong monetary policy, the increase in transaction cost is the real cause for economic recession. Think more deeply, the negative effect of wrong monetary policy is precisely leading to the increase in transaction cost because it is the transaction cost of monetary system due to the instability of monetary value.</p>
<p>In the next lecture, we will explain in detail that it is precisely the change in the proportion of transaction cost in social wealth (national income) that is the key to determine the economic performance.</p>
<p>Keynes&#x2019;s analysis on the equilibrium condition of national income is completely wrong! Based on this wrong analysis, Keynes put forward the &#x201C;paradox of thrift&#x201D;, arguing that too little consumption and too much saving will lead to insufficient aggregate demand and economic recession. Thus, he advocates more consumption and less saving, and criticizes the traditional virtue of thrift. However, if there is little saving, where can investment come from? Even Marx knows that expanded reproduction needs surplus products. Keynes&#x2019;s argument has also been refuted the facts that East Asian countries with high savings rates outperform economically other developing countries with low savings rates.</p>
<p>According to the correct analysis, if government wants prevent economic recession, it should adopt the monetary policy that stabilizes the monetary to prevent economic fluctuation, and should try to reduce transaction cost to reverse people&#x2019;s pessimistic expectation for the future. These are precisely the effective solutions.</p>
