<p>As has been analyzed in the previous section, it is wrong that Keynes&#x2019;s theory of national income determination thinks saving is different from investment, and the increase in saving will reduce aggregate demand, thus decreasing national income.</p>
<p>There are still more mistakes in Keynes&#x2019;s theory. Based on the wrong conclusions, Keynes believes that government should try to increase aggregate demand, stimulate consumption and encourage investment to fight against economic recession. He also puts forward the &#x201C;Theory of Multiplier&#x201D; to illustrate that the policy of increasing aggregate demand can increase several times more of national income. The key to this magic is that MPC is less than 1.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the investment (i) has increased by 100 units for some reason, according to the equilibrium formula of y&#xFF1D;c&#xFF0B;i, national income (y) has also increased by 100 units. However, do not forget the consumption function (c&#xFF1D;a&#xFF0B;by). When y increases by 100 units, consumption (c) also increases by &#x201C;by&#x201D; (100b) units. Suppose MPC&#xFF1D;b&#xFF1D;0.8, so c has increased by 80 units. And c is also a component of y&#xFF1D;c&#xFF0B;i, so y also increases by 80 units. Once y has increased by 80 units, according to c&#xFF1D;a&#xFF0B;by, it will cause c to increase by 0.8&#xD7;80&#xFF1D;64 units. The increase in consumption again leads to the increase in national income according to the equilibrium formula, and the increase in national income in turn leads to the increase in consumption according to the consumption function ... Such cycle continues, just like the monetary multiplier introduced in Lecture 19.</p>
<p>Let us arrange the increase in national income of each round. In the first round, the increase in investment (i) leads to the increase in national income (y) by 100 units. In the second round, the increase in consumption (c) leads to the increase in y by 80 units. In the third round, the increase in c leads to the increase in y by 64 units ... Obviously, it is an infinite decreasing geometric progression, and each value is 0.8 of the previous value, which is precisely MPC. Thus, how much has national income increased in the end? According to the summation formula of infinite decreasing geometric progression, the answer is $\frac{a_1}{1 - q} = \frac{100}{1 &#x2013; 0.8} = 500$. The initial investment (i) increases by 100 units, while the final national income (y) has increased by 500 units, which is 5 times the growth of investment and so is the multiplier. As the increase in national income stems from that in expenditure, it is called &#x201C;expenditure multiplier&#x201D;, and the general formula is $\frac{1}{1 - MPC}$. The above example is about the increase in investment expenditure, so it can also be called &#x201C;investment multiplier&#x201D;. If it is the increase in consumption expenditure that leads to that in national income, it is called &#x201C;consumption multiplier&#x201D;.</p>
<p>This theory of multiplier of Keynes seems like the magic of Midas touch. As long as a kind of expenditure increases a little, national income will increase by several times. Only with common sense, one can know it is impossible, but there have been so many believers for decades.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some even advocate an absurd theory of broken windows. The show windows of a shop haven been broken by a thief, so the shopkeeper has to buy new glass to replace the broken windows, which means his expenditure has increased and the seller of glass has also increased his income. The seller of glass will spend part of the increased income, so the seller of the relevant good has also increased his income and will also spend part takes out part of the increased income&#x2026;Such cycle continues, so national income of the whole economy will increase by several times in the end, which attributes to the thief who has broken the windows. If it were not for him, how would the shopkeeper increase expenditure on new glass, and how can there be a series of cycle increases in income and consumption? It is so absurd that this theory of broken windows advocates that &#x201C;Theft is justified.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was a clear-minded person (not even an economist) long ago who has pointed out the mistake of the theory of broken windows. A reporter of New York Times has written a small book that easily overthrows this myth. The money the shopkeeper spends on new glass might have been intended to buy a pair of shoes, but with broken windows he is forced to divert the money to the new glass, so his planned expenditure on new shoes disappears. According to the theory of multiplier, the income of the seller of shoes has decreased, so he has to cut some of his expenditure, which has reduced the income the seller of the relevant good, and the latter also has to cut some of his expenditure&#x2026; Such cycle continues, so national income of the whole economy will decrease by several times in the end, which also attributes to the thief who has broken the window. If it were not for him, how would the shopkeeper decrease expenditure on new shows, and how can there be a series of cycle decreases in income and consumption?</p>
<p>In other words, the advocators of the theory of broken windows have a pair of problematic eyes of only seeing part of the facts, because they only see the destruction of glass has led to an increase in some unplanned expenditure, but not see that some planned expenditure has also decreased as a result.</p>
<p>One may ask what if the shopkeeper has not planned to buy a new pair of shoes. If the money is not planned for expenditure, it will be saved. As mentioned in the previous section, saving will turn into investment. If it is deposited in a bank, the bank will lend it to those who need to consume or invest. In a word, from the perspective of the whole economy, the money will always be spent on someone&#x2019;s expenditure and will not disappear even if it is not spent on new glass.</p>
<p>Which one is larger, the increase in national income caused by the increase in unplanned consumption larger, or the decrease in national income caused by the decrease in planned consumption or investment? It seems to involve complicated calculations of the elasticity of demand, supply and output. In fact, there is an easy method to go round all the complexities. The thief has broken the windows, which is sure to lead to less wealth, so how can theft be justified to increase wealth? Of course, there is a Chinese idiom &#x201C;Without destroying the old, one cannot build the new.&#x201D; But if there is a plan to destroy the old and then build the new, self-interested people will calculate the loss of destroying and gain of building to make sure the loss is less than gain. How can the unplanned loss caused by a thief happen to be less than the gain of being forced to buy new glass? If it were, the shopkeeper would have broken the windows himself and need not wait for the thief to &#x201C;help&#x201D;.</p>
<p>According to the logic of the theory of broken windows, should government encourage instead of punish theft? Only a fool would believe such a ridiculous theory. However, there do be economists cheering and applauding the major disasters such as earthquake, believing that they can help to increase investment expenditure and thus stimulate economic growth. If disasters were really good for economy, government should just bomb out buildings during economic recession, then rebuild them, then bomb out them again, then rebuild them again ... then the economy would recover strongly. Bombing out buildings might be too troublesome, and government would better encourage people to commit suicide, then more babies could be born, and the cost of raising a child could be much more than rebuilding a house. When the children grow up, they should be encouraged to commit suicide again. According to this logic, terrorists and killers are contributors to economic growth!</p>
