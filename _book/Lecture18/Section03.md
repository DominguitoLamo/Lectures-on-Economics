# Section 3: The Discount Formula

Based on the concept of interest, a number of relevant concepts, including income, wealth, annuity income, assets, capital and investment, will be introduced in this section.

Let us begin with the concept of “Income”. The concept of cost and rent introduced in the previous lectures are all related to income, but this concept has not been introduced, because the nature of it can be explained clearly only in the theory of interest. As mentioned at the very beginning of this lecture, the theory of interest was basically founded by Fisher who had a famous saying about income, “Income is a series of events.” What does it mean?

In section 1, there is an example. Suppose one is given 100 units of grain now, he can sow them as seeds in the field. One year later, there will be more than 100 units of grain as harvest. Attention: he does not obtain the income one year later at the moment of harvest. During the process of the growth of the grains, every day and even every moment there is income that is always changing and different from day to day, sometimes may even be negative such as the wind blowing and the rain hitting the leaves, flowers or ears of corn. Thus, income is a series of events.

There is a way to categorize magnitude by time interval or time point in statistics: flow vs. stock. For example, if water is poured into a pool through a pipe, the amount of water flowing into the pool during a period of time is a flow, while the amount of water in the pool at a certain time-point is a stock. There are some key points about flow and stock.

(1) Different flows can be summed up. For example, if during one hour there is 1 cubic meter of water flowing in, during two hours there will be 2 cubic meters.

(2) Different stocks cannot be summed up. For example, if the stock of water in the pool at 9 o’clock is 1 cubic meter and that at 10 o’clock is 2 cubic meters, these two amounts cannot be added up.

(3) The difference of two stocks is the flow during the period between the two corresponding time-points. For example, if the stock of water in the pool at 10 o’clock is 2 cubic meters and that at 9 o’clock is 1 cubic meter, the difference of them is 1 cubic meter that is the flow from 9 to 10 o’clock.

Income is a series of events, so income is a flow that is not achieved at a certain moment, but formed by continuous events over a period of time.

By contrast, “Wealth” is a stock, but it is not the simple summation of all incomes, because as mentioned in section 1, the same good at different time is actually different goods, and cannot be directly summed up. The income of different periods must be converted into the income of the same period before they are summed up. There are two kinds of conversion: one is to convert the present income (value) into the future income (value), the other is to convert the future income (value) into the present income (value), which is called “discount” and is more usually used.

Suppose there is RMB100 now, which is the present value, what is the future value of it one year later? Suppose the interest rate of one year is 10%, so if this RMB100 is deposited in the bank, and one year later it will become 100×（1+10％）＝110. Thus, the future value of RMB100 one year later is RMB110 (with an interest rate of 10%).

How about two years later? Here we should pay attention to “compound interest” which means when the RMB110 is deposited in the bank for another more year, not only the principal of RMB100 will receive interest, but the interest of the first year (RMB10) will also receive interest, so the future value two years later is 110×（1+10％）＝121.

To generalize the above example, the formula for future value is $FV = PV (1 + i)^{t}$, where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, i is the interest rate, and t is the times of compound interests. Attention: in reality, the compound interest is not necessarily annual. For example, in usury, compound interest is usually monthly, so t is 12 for a year! The borrowers of usury are burdened with heavy interest, and there are the cases that the interest is even higher than the principal, not only because of the high interest rate, but also because t is so large that the interest becomes more and more rapidly like a snowball.

Compound interest is destructive because it leads to exponential growth in interest. There is a story that an Indian chess player played with the king and won. The king asked him what reward he required. He asked for the grains filling the cells of the chessboard as followed: 2 grains were put in the first cell, and then 4 grains in the second cell, and then 16 grains in the third cell…in other words, the number of grains in each cell should be quadratic of the number in previous cell, until all 64 cells were filled. The king thought it was only a small number, but the number of grains increased exponentially, so finally even he had used up all the grains in his country, he still could not meet the requirement of the player.

Let us reverse the above question: suppose there will be RMB100 one year later, which is the future value, what is the present value of it? Suppose the interest rate of one year is 10%, so if a sum of money (PV) is deposited in the bank, and one year later it will become 100, which means PV（1+10％）＝100. Thus, the present value of RMB100 is $PV = \frac{100}{1 + 10\%} = 90.91$ (with an interest rate of 10%).

If the future value of two years later is RMB100, it is $PV (1 + 10\%)^{2} = 100$, or $PV = \frac{100}{1 + 10\%}^{2} = 82.64$. To generalize the above example, the formula for present value or the discount formula is $PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^{t}}$.

If an investment project lasts over a period of compound interest and there are different incomes in each period, the incomes of each period should be discounted respectively, and then summed up like $\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{FV_t}{(1+i)^{t}}$. Different investment projects have different risks, so i is also different and should be estimated according to the different constraints. Because it is used to discount the future incomes, it is also called “Discount Rate”. The risks of each period may also be different, and i will change accordingly. If there is different i in different period, the discount formula for a certain period should be $\frac{FV_t}{(1 + i_1) (1 + i_2)…(1 + i_t)}$ . If an investment project lasts infinitely, the n in the formula should be replaced by infinity. It is not an unrealistic assumption. In Great Britain, there is a bond (Consol) that has not date of maturity, which means it pays perpetual interest and never repays the principal. Stocks are typical in never-repaying principals. One of the basic assumptions of general accounting is the “going-concern assumption” which also assumes that a firm will keep running in the future and will not go bankruptcy or liquidation.

"Wealth" refers to the sum of the discounted values of all incomes. As mentioned in Lecture 12, the concept of rent is the income of production factor or the value of asset from the first perspective. At that time, because the factor of time has not been introduced, readers may not realize that there is time dimension for the concept of income. Incomes at different times are not comparable, so they need to be discounted before summed up. In other words, there is time dimension for the concept of rent, just like income, while there is no time dimension for the value of asset or wealth.

The above concept of income, rent value, value of asset and wealth are all those from the perspective of producers. If from the perspective of consumers, the use value of a good is also value. From consuming a good, one also obtains income that is non-monetary income or enjoyment from consumption. Think deeply, producers’ monetary income from assets will eventually be used to purchase goods for consumption. Money itself is meaningless, but it can exchange for the enjoyment from consumption, which is the ultimate purpose of earning money.  As mentioned before, there is no essential difference between the final consumption good and the production factor, because the former can be regarded as the production factor used to produce human. Here is the reverse perspective: the monetary income of a production factor is ultimately non-monetary income or enjoyment from consumption, so they are the same in essence. Thus, both the value of asset and the use value of a good are values, actually wealth that is the sum of the discounted values of all incomes (including monetary and non-monetary income).

The definition of Capital Asset is that any that can bring in income is an asset. If non-monetary income is also taken into account, all goods are assets, because one can not only obtain monetary income by selling a good, but also obtain non-monetary income by consuming it. A good (an asset) is valuable because it can bring in income, and the price of it is the sum of the discounted value of future income. Why? Here is an example as follows.

Suppose one is holding a 3-year bond with a face value of RMB1000 and can receive a fixed annual interest of RMB100. He has held it for 2 years. Now he wants to sell the bond. What is the price?

Obviously, the buyer is willing to buy this bond because the sum of the discounted value of the income of it one year later is not lower than the price that is the cost he has to pay now. Suppose the interest rate used as the discount rate is 8%, the income for a bondholder one year later is the sum of interest of RMB100 and the principal of RMB1000, so the present value of it is $\frac{1000 + 100}{1 + 8\%} = 1018.52$. As long as the price of the bond is not higher than RMB1018.52, someone will buy it. Under the competition, the price of it will eventually be RMB1018.52.

In other words, the sum of the discounted value of future income is the price of an asset or a good. And the price of an asset price and interest rate (discount rate) is reciprocal, which means the higher the interest rate, the lower the asset price, and vice versa.

There were reports that the yield rate of the Treasury bond of Greece rose in the financial news during the European sovereign debt crisis. The yield rate is the interest rate of the Treasury bond, and its rising actually implied the decline in the price of it. Few investors were willing to buy, so the oversupply leads to a decline in the price. What is more, as mentioned in section 2, high yield rate must come from high risk. The increase in the yield rate on the Treasury bond does not mean a rise in the rate of return or the pure interest rate, but a rise in the risk premium added to the pure interest rate. Here the rising risk is the risk of default.

The above example implies a premise that different buyers have the same information, so they use the same discount rate. If different buyers have different information, they will use different discount rates, and the sum of the discounted values of the future income will be different, which leads to different “reasonable” price of the asset. Under competition, those who evaluate the asset a higher price will buy it from those who evaluate it a lower price, but they may be wrong in overestimating it, and be punished by the market in the form of investment losses.

The basic theory of finance or investment is not difficult, and this discount formula is almost the all. Based on the discount formula, there are two criteria for investment decision. One is the “Present-Value Rule”, which means one should choose the project with positive present value, and larger the better. The other is the “Rate of Return (ROR) rule”. The ROR is sometimes called the Internal Rate of Return. The ROR for any project is defined by setting up an equation in present value form, but with the discount rate treated as an unknown. The discount rate that makes this present value equal to zero is the ROR. One should choose the project with a ROR not lower than the interest rate in the market (such as the lending rate of bank), and the higher the better.

The difficulty lies in how to determine the discount rate. As mentioned before, the key constraints determining the stock prices are difficult to get to know, and are always changing quickly, which implies there is very high information cost.

Besides the discount rate, the future income of some assets is also uncertain. The above example is about a bond with fixed interest rate, so the annual interest can be determined in advance, but if it is a stock that neither repays the principal nor has the obligation to pay a dividend every year, the future income also needs to be estimated according to the information (such as the company’s operation in the future). Different investors have different information, and because there is high information cost that makes the behaviors of price-making are rather common in the financial market, who knows what the “reasonable” price is.

As has been pointed out in Lecture 3, the seemingly irrational behaviors in the stock market (financial market) are actually due to ignorance. Those who make money either rely on having more sufficient and accurate information or are just lucky. Luck is a random factor that makes investors win or lose, and in the long run the net effect will be null. In other words, what those who can make money in the long run (ROR is higher than the pure interest rate) earn must be the rent of information.

For the investments that do not rely heavily on time (such as the investments on real estate or doing business), although there is also high information cost, because the constraints do not change so quickly, those who have do detailed surveys and have rich experiences will have a higher chance of making money, and also earn information rent.

Taking real estate as an example, the price of a house is actually determined by the sum of the discounted values of future rent. What is the difference between selling a house at one time and renting it forever? In the former case, a large sum of money is obtained for once, while in the latter case, a small amount of rent is obtained for each period but lasts forever. The sum of the discounted values (present value) of all future rent in the latter case must be equal to the large sum of money in the former case. If it were lower, the owner of the house will choose to sell the house now. If it were higher, he will choose to hold the house for collecting rents. This kind of “arbitrage” behaviors (buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price to obtain the difference) will make the price of a house tends to be equal to the present value of the rents of it. Attention: the price of a house is determined by the sum of the discounted values of future rents of it, not the current rent. As for the future, expectation must be taken into account. As mentioned in Lecture 8, expectation is intention, and should be transferred to the objective facts that form the expectation. Different people have different expectations because they have different information, so information cost again plays a key role.
