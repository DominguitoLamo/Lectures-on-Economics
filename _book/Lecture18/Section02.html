                                <h1 id="section-2-interest-rate">Section 2: Interest Rate</h1>
<p>In reality, there are various kinds of interest rates. When one walks into a bank, he will find there are all kinds of interest rates: for demand deposits including installment savings and call deposits, and for time deposits, the durations of which include 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years. These are interest rates for deposit. If one walks into a bank in order to borrow money, there will be even more interest rates that are different for different borrowers (individuals or firms) and for different loan projects. If one does not borrow money through banks but private lending, the interest rate is usually higher.</p>
<p>There are so many different interest rates because they are not pure interest rates, but mixed with other factors which fall into two categories: one is transaction cost, and the other is inflation.</p>
<p>The factor of inflation will be explained in the later lecture of &#x201C;Monetary Theory&#x201D;. Here is only a brief conclusion: when there is money in an economy, there will be two kinds of value for many variables, Real Value and Nominal Value. The nominal value is the value expressed in money. If there is inflation or deflation, it is different from the real value. The interest rates observable in reality are nominal, and are also called monetary interest rates. The relationship between the nominal value and real value is roughly &#x201C;nominal value&#xFF1D;real value&#xFF0B;expected inflation rate&#x201D;. For example, if there is expectation of inflation, the long-term interest rate will be higher than the short-term interest rate, because the future currency will depreciate relative to the current one and needs to be compensated with more interest.</p>
<p>However, if there is only the factor of inflation, when deflation is expected, the long-term interest rate should be lower than the short-term one, because the future currency will appreciate relative to the current one and needs to be subsidized back with less interest. It is much more usually that the long-term interest rate is higher than the short-term one, because there is also the factor of transaction cost.</p>
<p>The factor of transaction cost affecting interest rate is usually risk (measured by information cost that is a kind of transaction cost). The longer the money is lent out, the more difficult it is to accurately predict the future, so the long-term interest rate is higher than the short-term one.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also the reason why the lending rate is often higher than the interest rate for deposit. The interest rate for deposit is used when individuals or firms lend money to a bank, and the credit of a bank is relatively reliable, which means the risk of default or even bankruptcy of a bank is relatively low, so the interest rate it borrows money is relatively low. By contrast, the lending rate is used when a bank lends money to individuals or firms, and the credit of individuals or firms is relatively unreliable, so the interest rate they borrow money is relatively high. A bank&#x2019;s income mainly comes from the difference between the interest rate for deposit and loan, and what it actually earns is transaction cost.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interest rate of private lending, especially usury, is usually much higher than lending rate of a bank. It is more difficult for individuals or firms repudiate a debt to banks, and laws also protect the right of banks to recover debts. Private lending is often used by borrowers with so poor credit or high risk that even banks are unwilling to lend money to them. In order to recover debts, illegal acts such as violence and gangdom that are not supported by laws, are often used, which implies high transaction cost.</p>
<p>Therefore, the truth of investment is that high rate of return must come from high risk. The higher rate of return (interest) is actually risk premium that is the price paid to those who are willing to bear higher risk. In other words, it is to pay higher transaction cost. All investment frauds make use of people&#x2019;s greed to make them believe that it is a high-yield but not high-risk investment. As the saying says, &#x201C;Money doesn&#x2019;t grow on trees&#x201D;. Only a fraud will seem to be out of line with it.</p>
<p>It is actually the application of the zero-profit theorem introduced in Lecture 15. According to zero-profit theorem, when all factors including rent and risk are taken into account, the profit for all producers in all kinds of industries must be the same or there can be no supernormal profit, because any industry with supernormal profit will attract outsiders to compete to enter, and competition will dissipate the income higher than cost (rent).</p>
<p>The same profit for all producers in all kinds of industries is precisely the interest rate. No matter what industry a producer is engaged in, he must input a sum of money, either from his own savings or borrowed from others. In the former case, the producer has given up the interest of depositing the money in bank, which is the opportunity cost of the money. In the latter case, the producer directly has to pay back interest as cost. Therefore, even if there is no inflation and risk, the profit margin must be enough to make up for the pure interest rate, or else people will choose to simply deposit the money in banks. If the profit margin is higher than the pure interest rate in an industry, people will borrow money from banks to invest (input) in that industry. Competition will make sure that the profit margin of all kinds of industries be the same as the pure interest rate.</p>
<p>In fact, it is the rate of return on investment of a society. The pure interest rate only clearly represents this rate of return in the form of market price. In other words, the pure interest rate is not determined subjectively by government, but objectively by a nations&#x2019; production efficiency (the ability of goods to appreciate in production over a period of time). If government directly controls interest rate, or uses monetary policy to influence it, it is similar to price control. As has been analyzed in Lecture 9, price control cannot really change the price of a good, but only mislead people to know the true price, which means increasing the information cost. In reality, due to the factor of inflation and risk, it is not easy for people to know the pure interest rate, which means there is cost for the information about the rate of return on investment by observing interest rate. If government interferes with the pure interest rate to make it more unreliable to represent the return on investment, people will be only misled more seriously to make wrong decisions. But government often blames on so-called &#x201C;market failure&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The closest to the risk-free pure interest rate is the rate for overnight loans in the interbank market, at which banks lend money to each other overnight. Why do banks do so? Because every day some deposit money into banks and some borrow or withdraw money from banks. The amount of money into and out of banks cannot be exactly the same, and the difference is called &#x201C;Position&#x201D;. Some banks are shortage of funds when they have less money in and more money out, which is called &#x201C;short position&#x201D;. They need to borrow money from other banks to make up for it, so they are the borrowers in the interbank market. Some banks, on the other hand, have more money in and less money out, and have surplus funds, which is called &#x201C;long position&#x201D;. If they do not lend out the surplus money, they will lose the interest, which is an opportunity cost, so they are the lenders in the interbank market.</p>
<p>The loan term for the overnight loans in the interbank market is very short, and all parties involved are banks, so the risk is very low (the transaction cost is very low), so the rate for it is the closest to the pure interest rate. In fact, many other interest rates are charged based on the rate for overnight loans in the interbank market by adding different risk premiums, and are also adjusted directly or indirectly along with it.</p>
<p>The most important rates for overnight loans in the interbank market are the Federal Funds Rate of US and LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) of UK. AS for China, it is SHIBOR (Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate). Although there is interest rate control in China, but the interbank market is not directly interfered with interest rate control, so the rate in it should be the most reliable indicator close to the pure interest rate.</p>
<p>Of course, the rates for overnight loans in the interbank market are always fluctuating. In theory, a nation&#x2019;s rate of return on investment will not fluctuate so frequently, but interest rate is also affected by the supply of money from central bank and the short-term changes in demand for money from the banking system and the entire financial system. The former is the major factor that interferes with rate for overnight loans in the interbank market to correctly reflect the pure interest rate. Since Greenspan was in charge of the Federal Reserve System (the central bank of US, Fed for short), the Fed has been very fond of implementing monetary policy by adjusting the federal funds rate, which is precisely one of the main reasons of the subprime crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, the scandal of LIBOR manipulation by large multinational financial institutions such as UBS (United Bank of Switzerland) has also been reported in European banking, which is price-making (as introduced in Lecture 17) in finance. Since information cost is one of the main causes of so many different interest rates in reality, of course the insiders will make use of the belief that LIBOR is the closest to pure interest rate to make price.</p>
