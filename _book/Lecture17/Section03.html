                                <h1 id="section-3-the-behaviors-increasing-information-cost">Section 3: The Behaviors Increasing Information Cost</h1>
<p>Since information asymmetry can bring information rent to those have more information, while it is information cost for those who have less information, there will be also behaviors increasing information cost. Previously, it is the behaviors of self-interested human reducing various costs including transaction cost that is discussed, but if increasing information cost can bring information rent, self-interested human will also do so.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of such behaviors increasing information cost.</p>
<p>(1) The concealment of information</p>
<p>Suppose the story of the movie &#x201C;2012&#x201D; happens in reality that all except one do not know the end of the world is coming. The One who knows can choose to inform the public so that all work together to build many Noah&#x2019;s Arks to save as many people as possible. And he can also choose to conceal the information and quietly build Noah&#x2019;s Arks for sale when the end of the world comes. What will he choose without the consideration about morality?</p>
<p>As for the former option, he cannot get income from the disclosure of information, while as for the latter option, he can profit from concealing information. From the perspective of the whole society, if he chooses the former, all can work together to build more Arks to save more lives, so the decrease in information cost by the disclosure of information is greater than the information rent brought to the one who knows by the concealment of information. However, he cannot get the benefit of reduction in information cost. Imagine that if he can get considerable part of the benefit from the society through negotiation, he will choose the former option. The question is how he can negotiate with the society if he does not disclose the information? So it goes back to the problem mentioned in Section 1: the transaction cost for trading information that is essentially public good is so high that the owner tends to protect his PPRs of information by concealment.</p>
<p>It is morality as another institution that plays a role in reducing transaction cost. The one who knows cannot get any monetary income from disclosing information, but all will respect him as a saint, which is very high non-monetary income.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the market as an institution has actually played a role in reducing transaction cost. If in a society, the PPRs of a good were not protected, the one who knows would even do not have the means to get information rent by selling Noah&#x2019;s Arks, so he would still not tell others about the information, but quietly build only a Noah&#x2019;s Ark to carry his loved ones to escape with him. As a result, fewer people would survive the end of the world.</p>
<p>Because this example involves the destruction of human beings, the psychological pressure of concealing information is very great, and it will not affect the escape of the one who knows if he discloses the information, which should be enough to overwhelm his self-interest. However, in some less extreme cases, concealment of information is often the optimum.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman once explained the function of PPRs and the market in reducing information cost. Suppose one knows how to grow grain on stones. If there were no PPRs and thus no market, he would not have the motivation to disclose this information.</p>
<p>If there were PPRs for grain but were not for information, he would quietly make use of the information to produce grain for sale. Although he did not disclose the information directly, others observed that he had no land but only stones and could supply food, which at least made the information of &#x201C;grain can be grown on stones&#x201D; leaked out by his sale of food. Of course, the key information on how to grow grain on stones is still unknown, but others will compete to discover the secret, which is easier to find than completely unaware of the original information that grain can also be grown on stones. </p>
<p>If there were PPRs not only for grain but also for information, he would choose to sell or rent the information to those who is good at growing grain and will certainly produce more food than the one who may be only good at inventing instead of farming. The increase in the output of grain reflects the increase in information rent from the protection of PPRs of information (or the reduction in rent dissipation or transaction cost).</p>
<p>It shows that PPRs and the market can guide the self-interested people to disclose information, thus reducing information cost and benefiting the whole society. In fact, it has been pointed out as early as in Lecture 3 that the market can guide self-interested human to benefit himself by benefiting others.</p>
<p>(2) Price-making</p>
<p>As mentioned in Lecture 16, the term &#x201C;price-making&#x201D; in MSE refers to monopoly, but here it is changed to refer to the other behavior of increasing information cost by spreading false information to mislead others, or known as &#x201C;cheating&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The case of Qin-chi mentioned in the previous section is a typical example of price-making. From this example, it can be concluded that price-making is not sustainably effective on the one hand, and it may eventually lead to doing more harm than good to the price-maker on the other hand. When Qin-chi won the bid of CCTV for the first time in 1996, the product quality and production capacity of it were enough to cover the cost of 66.66 million, so the sales volume and profit margin of that year greatly increased. However, the bid price of 320 million in 1997 had been totally out of line with the real capability of it.</p>
<p>Price-making is popular in the market of artwork. Some price-making are rather successful, because the artworks are really good, but the authors are not famous at the beginning, and need to attract the attention by price-making. When the quality of the artworks has been recognized, the high price made will not fall. In other words, the successful price-making is actually a behavior reducing information cost. However, most of the price-making in artworks is not successful in the long run, which is equivalent to the case of Qin-chi. The high price is out of line with the real quality or capacity, so it is unsustainable. Due to the successful price-making, many believe that only by price-making, they can make money out of thin air. After all, Qin-chi in 1997 was so crazy because it was cheated by the super success in 1996.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem still lies in information cost. If information cost is low enough, the artworks or firms with good quality can be discovered immediately without publicity, and they will be immediately and accurately priced by the market, there will be no need for price-making. Or no one will be cheated, and the price-making cannot be successful even in the short run, so there will be no room for price-making.</p>
<p>In a word, self-interest is good in that human will try to reduce cost (including transaction cost), while it is also harmful in that human will also try to increase cost which is precisely transaction cost. However, self-interest can be harmful just because there is transaction cost.</p>
