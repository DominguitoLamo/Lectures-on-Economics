# Section 6: Insurance

For the law of large numbers, although it is not useful to predict specific events because the applicable conditions are not satisfied, it is the foundation of the insurance industry. Since risk will mislead people make wrong decisions, they are averse to risk, just as they do not like cost, which is better understood by replacing the concept of risk with information cost. Thus people are willing to pay a price in exchange for others to take risk. This price is called “risk premium” in finance and investment, which implies that there is a market for risk and information cost can be priced. In the financial market, the behavior of purchasing risk is called “speculation” which has nothing to do with the law of large numbers. However, if the law of large numbers is applied to purchase risk, it is “insurance”.

For example, suppose one has 1 million worth of property. If the property is insured, once it is stolen or destroyed, the insurance company is responsible for compensating him 1 million to ensure that his wealth remains unchanged, thus transferring the risk of property loss to the insurance company. Of course, he has to pay a price for this insurance which is the insurance premium (while the one million is the insured amount).

If an insurance company can accept insurance widely, it can accurately calculate the compensation expense according to the law of large numbers. Although it is impossible to know precisely whether a specific subject-matter insured will be lost and need compensation, according to the law of large numbers, a specific ratio of subject-matters insured is sure to be lost. Thus, the information that an insurance company needs to have is not which specific subject-matter insured will be lost, but the probability of a large number of subject-matters insured to be lost. Since there is the law of large numbers that can be used to calculate the probability, the relevant information cost drops significantly. An insurance company actually does not changed the risk, but change the type of information it needs to have: from the type with higher information cost to that with lower information cost.

Suppose that there are 100 persons with the same constraints, and each insures 1 million of property. The insurance company estimates that the accident rate of them is 1% according to the law of large numbers based on past experience data, which means the compensation expenditure can be calculated as 1 million. The insurance company can make up for this compensation expenditure by collecting 10,000 of insurance premiums from each policyholder.

Therefore, the essence of insurance is that all gather together to help the 1% unfortunate persons who have suffered from accidents. It does not depend on one’s mercy, but on the reliable exchange condition that once he suffers from accident, others will come to help him. Philanthropy also advocates mutual help, but it does not guarantee as an insurance contract with clear contract terms and legal protection. Of course, philanthropy can save some transaction cost such as the cost of insurance companies and insurance contracts. It is precisely why human do not rely solely on the insurance industry (the market) but also philanthropy (morality).

As mentioned in previous section, the perquisite of the law of large numbers is that the test condition is unchanged. In reality, different person must have different constraint, so the insurance company will investigate one by one to know the relevant information and charge different premium rate.

What is more, as mentioned before, people will choose to increase information cost as long as it is beneficial to him. In the insurance industry, the behavior of concealing information is more common and serious than in other industries. It is why the “principle of utmost good faith” is one of the four basic principles in the insurance law. As long as one of the parties is found to have violated this principle, the counterparty can declare the insurance contract invalid.
