<p>There is often information asymmetry between buyers and sellers that sellers seem to be smarter than buyers just because sellers know more than buyers. However, it is the opposite in the insurance industry. The insured (buyer of insurance) usually knows the risk status of the subject-matter insured better than the insurance company (seller of insurance), because he is the holder of the subject-matter insured. By contrast, in ordinary commodity trading, the seller holds the commodity before it is sold.</p>
<p>What is more troublesome is that the insured not only knows the risk status of the subject-matter insured better than the insurance company before the insurance contract is concluded, but also still holds it after that, and how he treats it may cause significant changes in the risk status. If the risk status changes, the premium rate (the price of insurance services) should change accordingly, but it is fixed when the contract is concluded. It is difficult for the insurance company to know the information of the changes, and more difficult to negotiate with the insured to change the premium rate even it has known the relevant information, which all means there is high transaction cost.</p>
<p>According to whether the risk (information cost) is before or after the insurance contract is concluded, it can be divided into two categories: adverse selection and moral hazard.</p>
<p>Adverse selection</p>
<p>Adverse selection refers that those with higher risk are more inclined to purchase insurance than those with lower risk, which causes the risk borne by the insurance company is actually higher on average than when all purchase insurance, so the premium rate calculated based on the average risk will be lower.</p>
<p>However, the insurance company will certainly not be so stupid to accept insurance without distinction and charge an average premium rate, but will certainly investigate the risk status of the insured and charge the premium rate accordingly. Take life insurance as an example, the younger the insured, the lower the premium rate. As the age increases, the premium rate will gradually rise. Those who are older than a certain age will be required to have a physical examination, and the insurance company will determine the premium rate and exception clause according to the results of the physical examination, or may even decide to decline. Of course, there will be definitely more cost than when there is no adverse selection, which reflects implies the information cost. As long as there is no government intervention, insurance companies will always try every means to control the adverse selection of the insured, or reduce the relevant information cost.</p>
<p>In fact, there is adverse selection not only exist in the insurance industry, but also in any fields where information asymmetry is serious. For example, banks all like to lend money to the well-run firms with low credit risk. The poor-run firms are very short of money and most in need of bank loans, so it is such high-risk firms that often come to borrow money from banks.</p>
<p>G. A. Akerlof (1940-) is Nobel Prize winner in economics of 2001 for his paper on how adverse selection caused by asymmetric information leads to the shrinkage and disappearance of the used car market. Since buyers do not know the information about the quality of used cars, they will offer a price according to the average quality of the used cars in the market. Those the quality of which is higher than the average level will not accept such a low price and withdraw from the market, which leads to a decline in the average quality of the used cars in the market, so the price offered by the buyers will also decline. Such a vicious circle will eventually make more and more used cars with a better quality above the average level leave the market, so more and more buyers also leave the market, resulting in shrinkage or even disappearance of the market. Because &#x201C;lemon&#x201D; is used in English slang to refer to an artifact (especially an automobile) that is defective or unsatisfactory, Akelof named it as &#x201C;lemon market&#x201D;.</p>
<p>However, this Nobel Prize-winning paper attempts to explain a fake phenomenon. In reality, there are not only used car markets everywhere, but also the most prosperous ones are exactly those where the high-quality luxury used cars are for sale. For example, there was a TV program in &#x201C;Financial and Economical Report of China&#x201D; in CCTV2 on October 16 in 2010 about the car market in Beijing, including some major used car markets. There are full of luxury cars in the used car markets, even more spectacular than in the new cars markets.</p>
<p>Akerlof is wrong in his extreme ignorance of not only facts but also true economics. Luxury cars with good quality have a much higher rent than those with poor quality, so of course they can afford much more information cost of checking the quality of used cars, which can more effectively eliminate the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. It is precisely the implication of the law of demand, or more specifically, the implication of the principle of rent matching introduced in Lecture 13: the more luxury cars with higher rent can match the higher information cost paid for better quality inspection of used cars.</p>
<p>(2) Moral hazard</p>
<p>The risk after the conclusion of the insurance contract is moral hazard which refers to the fact that once the insured has the protection of the insurance contract, he will become negligent in preventing the risk. As a result, the probability of the risk is higher than that before the conclusion of insurance contract, which makes the premium rate in the insurance contract be too low.</p>
<p>For example, if one has car without insurance, he will drive very carefully, pay attention to locking and guarding against theft, and try his best to prevent risk as much as possible. However, once insured, since the insurance company is responsible for compensation, one may tend to drive recklessly and not be so careful to guard against the car thieves. It is again the implication of the law of demand. Once the insurance premium is paid, it becomes a historical cost and no longer a constraint to restrict the behaviors of the insured, which means the cost of risk falls, so the insured naturally become inclined not to prevent risk.</p>
<p>In Lecture 3, there is the reading material about how the law on mandatory installation of airbags will objectively encourage drivers to drive recklessly. Some argues that the law on mandatory purchase of the third party liability insurance<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> for cars will have the same adverse effect. Indeed, if the law stipulates that an insurance company must accept the driver&#x2019;s insurance and is not allowed to adjust the premium rate, it will lead to an increase in the probability of risk. However, as long as it is not the case, the insurance company will take measures to control moral hazard. But how?</p>
<p>There is a clause in an insurance contract that if a traffic accident is settled in one year, the premium rate for the next year will be automatically increased by a certain percentage, even if the insured is not responsible for the accident. Obviously, with this insurance clause, no driver will dare to take chances and engage in moral hazard. The insurance company will raise the premium rate indiscriminately without checking who is responsible for the accident, apparently in order to prevent the driver from bribing the traffic police, thus saves the information cost of investigating the truth as well as the trouble for the insured of bribing the traffic police and deceiving the insurance company. In other words, the transaction costs have been reduced by double due to such seemingly &#x201C;imparity clause&#x201D; insurance contract. In the contracts of accidental injury and medical insurance, there is also similar clause complemented with a &#x201C;reward&#x201D; clause that the premium rate will be reduced there is no compensation for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>In reality, people will never do nothing with the information cost caused by adverse selection and moral hazard. Instead, they must try their best to reduce the information cost by controlling these two kinds of behaviors. As an economist, he may not be as smart as the competitor in the market, and all he should do is investigate carefully how people reduce costs (including information cost or transaction cost).</p>
<p>By the way, strictly speaking, the insurance based on the law of large numbers mentioned above is &#x201C;consumption insurance&#x201D; which means if the specified accident has not happened during the insurance period, the premium paid to the insurance company will not be returned, just like the consumption. Property insurance, personal accident insurance and medical insurance all belong to this kind of insurance. There is also pension insurance belonging to savings insurance which means the policy holders pay premiums when they are young, and the insurance companies return them annuity when they are old. This kind of insurance is actually saving (people deposit money in banks and withdraw it when necessary).</p>
<p>In principle, not like consumption insurance, saving insurance does not compensate the insured whom an accident has happened to, with the premium of the other insured whom no accident has happened to, but pays annuity later with the premium previously paid by the insured. Therefore, if one&#x2019;s insurance compensation is paid by the others&#x2019; premium in savings insurance, it is similar to stealing money from others, which is strictly forbidden by insurance laws.</p>
