# Lecture 10: Consumer Theory

In the textbook of MSE, it is usually consumer theory after the TSD.

However, with the law of demand as an axiom, consumer theory is actually redundant, because it tries to derive the law of demand as a theory. In consumer theory, there are two axioms (comparison axiom and transitivity axiom), a concept of “utility” and an analysis by using indifferent curves, with which a price expansion path due to price changes are drawn to deduce a demand curve. Nevertheless, with the disturbance of the Giffen good, this demand curve cannot be sure to slope downwards, so it is necessary to assume that there is no Giffen good. In short, if the explanatory power of consumer theory is as strong as the law of demand, there must be much more contents, which make the theory extremely complicated.

According to “Occam’s Razor” in the methodology of science introduced in Lecture 8, the law of demand is obviously better than consumer theory. What’s more, the concept of utility and indifferent curve, on which consumer theory depends deeply, are both intentions. When applying them to explain phenomena, one must first try to find observable facts to replace them, which also make the applications much more complicated. There are traps of tautology easily to fall into.

Furthermore, in practical application, the explanatory power of the law of demand law is much stronger than consumer theory. As pointed out in the last section of Lecture 8, if the variable of “price” is interpreted broadly as “cost”, not only the behaviors of consumers but also of producers can be explained. If it is further interpreted as “constraint”, the law of demand can actually explain all human’s behaviors. That is why the law of demand is not just an ordinary theory but an axiom in economics.

In fact, there is no need for practitioners to learn consumer theory. Then why do I still write this lecture? Because this theory is strong in logic, and it is good for training the logical thinking. However, if you want to explain phenomena, do not expect consumer theory to be helpful, and the law of demand is much simpler and more useful.
