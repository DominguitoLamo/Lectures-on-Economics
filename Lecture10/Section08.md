The law of demand only tells us that the demand curve has negative slope. As shown in Fig.10-14, both D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> are demand curves with different negative slopes, but the rises in quantity demanded caused by the same fall in price from P to P’ are quite different for these two demand curves. Obviously, the rise in quantity demanded for D<sub>1</sub> with flatter negative slope is much more than that for D<sub>2</sub> with steeper negative slope. In reality, a slight change in the price of some goods does cause a larger change in quantity, while a large change in the price of other goods just causes a little change in quantity. In other words, there are different sensitivities to price changes for different shapes of demand curves, which are measured by “Elasticity” in economics.

The concept of elasticity in economics is again copied from physics. Elasticity in physics refers to the sensitivity of deformation of an object to changes in force. For example, if a spring will stretch a lot when pulled lightly, it is elastic. By contrast, if a spring will only stretch a little when pulled hard, it is inelastic. Human’s skin is another typical example. It is very elastic because it will cave in when pressed lightly with a finger. By contrast, the surface of a table seems not change at all when pressed hard with a finger, unless it is watched carefully with a microscope, so the table is very inelastic.

It is Marshall again who copied the concept of elasticity from physics to economics, because the extent of quantity changes caused by price changes is equivalent to that of the deformation of an object caused by force. Elasticity coefficient is also used to measure elasticity, such as 

$$η≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP}}{\frac{Q}{P}} ≡ \frac{ΔQ}{ΔP} \frac{P}{Q}$$.

 $$\frac{\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\frac{ΔP}{P}}$$
 
  is the definition formula of the price elasticity coefficient of demand. The numerator of it is the proportionate change in quantity purchased (i.e. the changing value divided by the initial value in quantity), while the denominator of it is the proportionate change in price (i.e. the change value of price divided by the initial value of price). This formula of elasticity measures a good’s sensitivity to changes in price. The reason why an elasticity measure defined in terms of proportionate changes is used is to avoid the difficulty of being affected by the units of measurement. For example, if the direct measure of $\frac{ΔQ}{ΔP}$ is used, how to compare the price elasticity of cars in China and that of planes in US when there are different weight units and different currencies. However, the effects of different units can be eliminated by using proportionate changes, so the elasticity of any good in any currency can be directly compared.

Because the demand curve has negative slope, the price elasticity of demand must be negative. There are three kinds of elasticity based on the relationship between its absolute value and unity. If the elasticity measure exceeds unity in absolute value, a demand curve is said to be “elastic”, which means the proportionate change in quantity is more than that in price. And the demand is said to be “inelastic” if the elasticity has an absolute value less than unity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is less than that in price. If the elasticity has an absolute value equivalent to unity, it is called “unitary” elasticity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is the same as that in price.

In addition, strictly speaking, the above formula of elasticity coefficient is used to calculate the arc elasticity. As the intervals and shrink toward zero, the arc elasticity approaches the point elasticity, and the formula of elasticity coefficient becomes $\frac{dQ}{dP}∙\frac{P}{Q}$. The left part of this formula is the reciprocal of the slope of the demand curve, which shows that the elasticity and the slope of the demand curve are not the same. If the demand curve is a straight line, the slope on each point is the same, but the elasticity varies along the curve. So it is rarely advisable to describe an entire demand curve as elastic (or inelastic). Rather, one should say that demand is elastic (or inelastic) in the neighborhood of some given price-quantity point. However, at the same price level, the elasticity of demand curves with different slopes can be compared. As can be seen from the Fig.10-14, the flatter the demand curve is, the more elastic it is. On the contrary, the steeper the demand curve is, the more inelastic it is.

Why should we care about elasticity? Because if a good is elastic or inelastic will affect the pricing strategy of the producer. If a good is elastic, when the producer only slightly raises the price, the quantity will drop sharply. However, when the producer slightly decreases the price, the quantity will greatly rise. Because the revenue from the sale is the price multiplied by the quantity, it is better for the producer to adopt the strategy of cutting the price to promote the sales, which can bring about an increase in revenue.

By contrast, if a good is inelastic, when the producer raises the price substantially, the quantity will not drop much. However, when the producer decreases the price substantially, the quantity will not increase much. For the inelastic good, the strategy of price cutting will only decrease the revenue. There is a Chinese saying that “Low prices for grain hurt the peasants”. The substantial rise in grain output during the harvest year will cause the price to drop sharply, but the consumptions will not increase much, thus causing the revenues of the peasants to fall instead of rise.

The concept of elasticity extends to many other fields. For example, from the supplements and substitutes discussed before, it can be seen that the price change in a good will not only affect the demand of itself, but also the demand for its supplements and substitutes. If the denominator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in price of a good) is changed to the proportionate change in price of another good, it is called the cross-elasticity of demand: 

$$η_{xy} ≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ_x}{Q_x}}{\frac{ΔP_y}{P_y}} ≡\frac{ΔQ_x}{ΔP_y } \frac{P_y}{Q_x}$$

Unlike the price elasticity of demand which is always negative, the cross-elasticity of demand can be positive or negative. If good X is the substitute of good Y, the quantity of X will rise along with the rise in the price of Y, so the cross-elasticity of a substitute is positive. By contrast, if good X is the supplement of good Y, the quantity of X will fall along with the rise in the price of Y, so the cross-elasticity of a supplement is negative.

If the denominator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in price of a good) is changed to the proportionate change in income, it is called the income elasticity of demand: 

$$ɛ≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\frac{ΔI}{I}} ≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{ΔI }}{\frac{Q}{I}} ≡ \frac{ΔQ}{ΔI}\frac{I}{Q}$$

 If the good is a superior good, the quantity of it will rise along with the rise in income, so the income elasticity of a superior good is positive. By contrast, if the good is an inferior good, the quantity of it will fall along with the rise in income, so the income elasticity of an inferior good is negative.

If the numerator of the coefficient formula (the proportionate change in quantity purchased) is changed to the proportionate change in quantity sold, it is called the price elasticity of supply: 

$$κ≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \frac{ΔQ}{ΔP} \frac{P}{Q}$$

, which seems the same as the formula for the price elasticity of demand 

($$η≡ \frac{\frac{ΔQ}{Q}}{\frac{ΔP}{P}} ≡ \frac{ΔQ}{ΔP } \frac{P}{Q}$$)

, but the Q in η means quantity purchased that is related to quantity demanded, while Q in κ means quantity sold that is related to quantity supplied. Since the supply curve is sloping upwards, the price elasticity of supply is always positive. There are also three kinds of price elasticity of supply based on the relationship between its value and unity. If the elasticity measure exceeds unity, a supply curve is said to be “elastic”, which means the proportionate change in quantity is more than that in price. And the supply is said to be “inelastic” if the elasticity has a value less than unity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is less than that in price. If the elasticity has a value equivalent to unity, it is called “unitary” elasticity, which means the proportionate change in quantity is the same as that in price.

In fact, one can put any different data into the numerator and denominator of the elasticity coefficient formula to create various kinds of elasticity. For example, in international finance, if one wants to study how much the devaluation or appreciation of a country’s currency affects the change in import or export volume, he can put the proportionate change in the value of currency value in the denominator, and the proportionate change in import or export volume in the numerator to calculate the monetary elasticity of import or export. Thus, there can be various kinds of elasticity in economics. Since the price elasticity of demand is the first elasticity, it is the default of elasticity if there is no specific statement.

However, elasticity is not really very useful in explaining phenomena or economic decisions, because so far economists have not found a reliable rule (theory) to determine how much the elasticity is in advance. If we cannot tell whether a good is elastic or inelastic until we observe the quantity drops significantly or slightly, we have not really used elasticity to explain the phenomena. The elasticity is again just a tautology, because it is always true ex post. The real explanation should be prediction ex ante. A useful theory of elasticity must be able to provide some clear principles, according to which one can know what are the constraints determining whether a good is elastic or inelastic, and then examine the reality to predict in advance whether the good analyzed is elastic or inelastic.

It is generally believed in MSE that there are three kinds of determinants (constraints) that affect the price elasticity of demand.

(1) Availability of substitutes: Demand for a good will be more elastic the more numerous and the closer the available substitutes.

(2) Luxuries versus necessities: Demand for a “luxury” tends to be more elastic than demand for a “necessity”.

(3) High-priced versus low-priced goods: Along a linear demand curve, elasticity is higher at higher prices.

However, unfortunately, all these three constraints are not binding, and meaningless in inference of the elasticity. For example, the first constraint about the availability of substitutes means how many there are substitutes and how strong the substitutability is. As mentioned in the section about substitutes in Lecture 8, any two seemingly unrelated commodities can become substitutes under specific constraints. There is a real example in marketing: the game makers found that a chocolate popular in middle school students had become a competitor or substitute for their products. The pocket money of middle school students was basically a fixed amount, so when they bought more chocolate, they had to cut their spending on other goods including games.

The second constraint about the division between luxuries and necessities, but is it really so easy to distinguish luxuries and necessities? For a businessman, luxuries are actually necessities. He needs the luxuries (such as BMW) as a signal to convey the information that he is doing well in business, earning high income, and therefore is very capable. Thus here is again the problem: under specific constraints, any seemingly luxuries can become necessities.

As for the third constraint, the boundary of high-priced goods and low-priced goods is even more ambiguous. There is no absolute high price or absolute low price, which again depends on specific constraints.

A. A. Alchian (1914-2013) proposed a much clearer constraints than the above three constraints: time. With the passage of time, the information cost about substitutes for a good will decrease. As a result, the number of substitutes will increase, and the good changes from inelastic to elastic. Alchian called it “the second law of demand.”

However, Steven N. S. Cheung, his student, found that the fact of the undersea tunnel in Hong Kong had refuted this second law of demand. Every time the toll of the undersea tunnel in Hong Kong is increased, the traffic will always fall significantly at first, and then gradually rise to the previous level. It seems that the undersea tunnel changes from elastic to inelastic, which is precisely contrary to the prediction of the second law of demand. The reason is quite simple. As soon as the toll of undersea tunnel is increased, people turn to other transportation means (such as ferries). But after a period of time they will find that all other transportation means are far less convenient than the undersea tunnel, so they turn back to it gradually.
In other words, with the passage of time, the information cost about substitutes does decrease, but it does not logically always result in the rise in the number of substitutes for a good. It is also possible that people find there are no substitutes good enough when they are better informed. Thus, the number of substitutes for the good actually drops rather than rises.

In conclusion, until now there has not been a theory of elasticity that can tell a good is elastic or inelastic in advance by determining the relevant constraints. There has been a concept of elasticity which is useless in explaining or predicting phenomena.
