# Section 4: The Problem in Keynes’s Consumption Function

There is another fatal weakness in Keynes’s theory of multiplier that it depends heavily on the consumption function. The logic that the increase in expenditure can cause several times of increase in national income depends on the fact that consumption (c) not only determines national income according to the equilibrium formula, but is also determined by national income according to the consumption function. Only when the two affect each other can such a circular effect be formed. The question is: Is the consumption function in reality like that advocated by Keynes?

Friedman, a leading figure of the monetary school, has been introduced in Lecture 6, but his criticism of Keynes’ theory is not limited to monetary theory. In 1957, he published the famous paper “A Theory of the Consumption Function” that contradicted Keynes’s consumption function and put forward the “Permanent Income Hypothesis”.

Friedman points out that Keynes’s consumption function is a theory of short-term (current) consumption, which means income (y) and consumption (c) in Keynes’s consumption function are current income (y<sub>t</sub>) and current consumption (c<sub>t</sub>). By contrast, Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis holds that there are two parts in current income: permanent income (y<sub>p</sub>) and temporary income (y’). Similarly, there are also two parts in current consumption: permanent consumption (c<sub>p</sub>) and temporary consumption (c’).

Permanent income refers to the stable income over a long period of time. It is calculated by multiplying the sum of the discounted value of expected future income by a stable interest rate, so it is stable and unchanged for each period. Permanent income is actually the “Annuity” introduced in Lecture 18. Similarly, permanent consumption refers to the stable consumption over a long period of time, and it is calculated by multiplying the sum of the discounted value of expected future consumption by a stable interest rate.

Because both permanent income and permanent consumption are stable, there is a definite functional relationship between them, namely c<sub>p</sub> =c(y<sub>p</sub>). However, temporary income is occasional income that cannot be expected. The same is for temporary consumption. From the statistical perspective, temporary income and temporary consumption are essentially random variables, so there is no definite functional relationship between them. Obviously, they are profits introduced in Lecture 12 because they are unexpected. By contrast, permanent income and permanent consumption are both expected.

Attention: permanent income or consumption is stable, which is based on some expectations, but expectations can be adjusted along with the change in the constraints, so they are called “Adaptive Expectations”. For example, one has won a lottery of 1 million, which cannot be expected in advance, so it is an unexpected profit that is temporary income. However, after it has happened, the winner knows for sure that his current wealth has increased by 1 million, which implies the constraint of wealth has changed. Suppose the stable interest rate is 10% per year, the winner can definitely expect that he has more income from the interest of 100,000 per year, so his permanent income will increase by 100,000. Therefore, that permanent income is stable does not mean it will never change, but only that it is the expectation based on the current constraints.

Thus, current income is y<sub>t</sub>＝y<sub>p</sub>＋y’, while current consumption is c<sub>t</sub>＝c<sub>p</sub>＋c’. Because temporary income (y’) and temporary consumption (c’) are random variables, current income (y<sub>t</sub> ) and current consumption (c<sub>t</sub>) are also random variables. Keynes believes there is functional relationship between current income and current consumption, which is completely wrong!

Of course, Friedman’s theory is only a “hypothesis”. The core content of his famous paper “A Theory of the Consumption Function” is precisely about the test of this hypothesis of permanent income. Once published, this paper has been regarded as a classic work not only because it criticized Keynes, but it has fully demonstrated Friedman’s profound ability as an economic master using statistical data to test theoretical hypotheses.

In fact, Friedman was a statistician before he became an economist. His work during the World War II was to design weapons and strategies and to analyze data from metallurgical experiments for the US army, so he was good at statistics. In the permanent-income hypothesis, there is the far-reaching influence of statistics.

For example, there are two parts in the current income (consumption): the fixed permanent income (consumption) and the uncertain temporary income (consumption), which is precisely the routine of statistics that in a regression equation there are two parts of the fixed functional variables and the uncertain random variables.

What is more, permanent income (consumption) is calculated by multiplying the sum of the discounted value of expected future income (consumption) by a fixed interest rate. The specific calculation is to give different weights to the expected income (consumption) at different times: the farther away from the present, the less accurate the expectation is, and the less influence on the current income (consumption), so the smaller the weight is. Obviously, from the statistical perspective, permanent income (consumption) is actually a weighted average.

Friedman’s permanent-income hypothesis has a very important policy implication: it has negated the policy implication of Keynes’s consumption function theory that the increase in (current) income can increase (current) consumption, thus stimulating economic growth. Only the economic policy can effectively increase permanent income, which means it can make people form the expectation that their incomes will increase in the future, will permanent consumption increase, thus increasing current consumption and effectively stimulating economic growth. However, the policies of stimulating aggregate demand advocated by Keynes can only increase temporary income and temporary consumption, and cannot increase current consumption at all, so the logic chain of multiplier effect is interrupted.
