# Section 3: The Explanation of “Buying on the upswing, Selling on the downswing” in the Stock Market

Last is the third example. There is a jargon called “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” in the stock market, which means investors tend to buy in when the stock price is up, while tend to sell out when the stock price is down. It seems that the more expensive, the more selling, and vice versa. Does it refute the law of demand? Again of course not. But why? Those who choose to buy a stock must expect that the stock price will rise, so the current price is lower than the expected future price, and vice versa. There are even no other factors that have changed in this phenomenon which just directly proves the law of demand.

What really makes an investor decide whether to buy in or sell out is not whether the current price is high or low, but whether the current price is higher or lower than the expected future price. Investors adopt the strategy of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” not because they tend to buy the more expensive stocks and sell the cheaper ones, but the rising price is usually easier to make them expect the price will continue to rise and decide to buy, and vice versa.

However, if the rising price of a stock will only lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise, will it rise endless? It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock. Obviously there are not such things in reality? In reality, the rising price of a stock does not necessarily lead to the expectation that it will continue to rise. When the price rises to a certain level, some will begin to doubt if it has reached the peak, and reverse to sell out to take profits. The higher the price, the more expectations will be reversed. When the number of investors who reverse to sell out exceeds that of those who expect the price will continue to rise, the market will suddenly reverse. It is vice versa for the falling price of a stock.

The problem in explaining of “buying on the upswing, selling on the downswing” is that the constraint of rising or falling price of a stock is not enough to determine investors’ behaviors. In other words, with this constraint alone, we cannot reliably predict what investors will behave (decide). The key factor to determine the behaviors in the stock market is actually expectation. However, expectation is a kind of psychological activity, which is like self-interest and quantity demanded as motives and intentions, and cannot be directly used to explain phenomena. Psychological factors or activities are not observable, so cannot be tested by facts, which will make the explanation irrefutable and become tautology.

There are two solutions: one is to add observable constraints, which is the solution to deal with self-interest and quantity demanded (as will be explained later, price is the observable constraint); the other is to replace psychological factors with observable constraints, which is precisely the solution to deal with expectation. It is impossible to observe what one expects in his mind, but it is possible to observe the objective factors that form the expectations. For example, the implementation of a policy beneficial to a company will make investors expect the price of the company's stock to rise. In principle, if one can know all the objective factors (constraints) that form investors’ expectations in the stock market, he can accurately predict whether the stock price will rise or fall, how much it will, and when it will. However, it is too difficult, in fact is impossible, to get to know all these constraints, which implies there is serious information cost (transaction cost). What is even more troublesome is that even if the information about the relevant constraints is available, they are changing every minute. Even one can know the relevant constraints for this moment, they may have changed the next minute, so the formation about them soon become useless and new information needs to be collected again.

This is the characteristic of the stock market (in fact, all financial markets). There are not only many key constraints, but also they change rapidly which means after they change for once, they will change again in a short time. It is different from the usual decision-making in other fields where there are relatively less key constraints and they are more stable which means after they change for once, they will not change again for a long time. Is the stock market or stock price predictable? The answer is: yes, and no. Yes, because if one can quickly and accurately get to know all the key information, by applying the law of demand, it is enough to predict precisely. No, because in fact no one can get to know all the key information quickly and accurately. There is a school called “technical analysis” based on the charts of stock prices in the past (such as K lines) to guess the future trend. This so-called analysis actually assumes implicitly that “what happened in the past will continue to happen in the future” which has nothing to do with science. From the perspective of science, what happened in the past is based on some specific constraints, and what will happen in the future is based on other specific constraints. Why must these two sets of constraints be the same? No logic or facts can support this assumption. Remind: assumption is different from postulate in that it must be consistent with facts. Due to the too high information costs of getting to know the key constraints, some investors choose to guess based on the constraints in the past, which is understandable (explainable), but there is no reliable scientific basis for such guesses.

There are many complicated mathematical models in current finance. However, no matter how complicated the mathematics is, it cannot save the theories with wrong assumption. Mathematics can only ensure that the deduction from the assumption to the conclusion is logically correct, but cannot ensure that the assumption itself is correct. There is an idiom in China that if one go in the wrong direction, the faster he goes, the farther away he will be from his destination.

Strictly speaking, the financial market is difficult to predict, not because the financial theories are very complicated (as mentioned previously, the law of demand is sufficient), but because it is too difficult to get to know the key constraints. It is irrelevant to overcome this difficulty by applying very complicated mathematics. However, not only economics is helpless for the financial market, but physics is also helpless in some cases because the relevant constraints are too difficult to get to know. The most typical case is that physics cannot predict the outcome of gambling. Take the simplest coin toss as an example. As long as a physicist can accurately and quickly get to know all the relevant constraints such as the force of throwing, gravity, air friction, winds force, etc., he is sure to predict which side of the coin will face up by applying Newton's law. However, because the duration of the coin being thrown up and then falling down is too short, the physicist cannot get to know all the relevant constraints in time. All he can do is to calculate the probability of which side facing up in many tosses (50% for the positive and 50% for the negative), instead of predicting which side facing up at a specific time. In fact, all a financial economist can do is also to calculate the probability of a certain status, but the happening of small probability event can never be ruled out, and it is most horrible or even deadly which is called “black swan event” in the stock market.

From this comparison with physics, it is obvious that the short duration of constraints is the most critical difficulty. The constraints are short-term, which not only means that economists and physicists are unable to get to know all the key constraints in time, but also the information about the constraints quickly expire even if they manage to know. By contrast, insurance, which belongs to finance, also relies on probability, but not influenced by short duration. What’s more, although there are also many complicated constraints in the investments in business, real estate, antique art, etc. other than in the financial market, neither is there the difficult of short duration of constraints. Therefore, economics as a science cannot predict the short-term fluctuations in financial markets, just as physics as a science cannot predict the results of gambling. Anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the stock market is a liar, because it is the same as anyone who tells you he is absolutely sure to make money in the casino is a liar.

Some may be still keep asking: if economics cannot predict the financial market, why are there so many securities analysts? And why are there so many people who spend money in enquiring them for forecasts about the stock market? Firstly, those who analyze based on the fundamentals of the companies and public news or inside stories actually investigate the long-term constraints. Of course, the key constraints that will influence the stock price cannot be only long-term ones, so such predictions based on the long-term constraints are helpless for short-term fluctuations. Secondly, as mentioned above, the school of so-called “technical analysis” does not investigate the relevant constraints, but only guess the future according to the past. In addition to the unscientific problem just pointed out, there is also the mistake of “explaining fact with fact” criticized by Marshall. However, this school in the financial market is not the only one who makes money by guessing. Fortune telling is the much older profession of the same nature. There have been always so many people who are willing to pay fortune tellers. What they buy may be just a peace of mind.
By the way, Burton Malkiel, a scholar of USA in his popular book “A random walk on Wallstreet” mocked that the return rate of the stock portfolio selected by a monkey with blinders randomly throwing darts would be almost the same as that of the stock portfolio recommended by securities analysts. In order to test this mock, a British magazine “Observe” held a stock-picking competition in 2012 among three teams: one is a cat, one is a group of securities analysts, and the other is a group of middle-school students. The result is that the cat did beat the other two groups of human by totally random selection.
