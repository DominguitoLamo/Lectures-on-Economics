# Section 4: The Selection of Other Factors –Methodology of Science (2): Occam’s Razor

There are more complicated issues to discuss about “other factors.” What on earth are the “other factors?” If “other factors” are any factors other than the price, then the question arises: if any factors other than the price remain unchanged, how can price change? What causes the price to change? So it is actually not simple for “other factors”. Some other factors cannot change, but it is wrong that any factors other than the price cannot change. In other words, other factors should be divided into two categories: changeable and unchangeable ones. Next we will analyze which other factors are unchangeable, and which are as changeable as the price.

There are three kinds of other factors. The first kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in demand, and they are unchangeable. As mentioned in the previous examples, weather (which directly affects the demand for umbrellas), information, quality (which directly affects the demand for clothes, MBA, etc.) and income are all unchangeable.

The second kind of other factors is those that directly lead to changes in price, and they must be changeable, because if they do not change, neither will the price change. For example, when it comes to the end of season, the price of off-season clothes will be cut dramatically in clearance sale for funds returning. The qualities of the clothes have not changed, and the buyers also have sufficient information, so they will rush to do shopping. It is precisely the implication of the law of demand! Other factors such as seasonal promotion directly affect the price, so they must be allowed to change.

The third kind of other factors is called “intermediate factors”, because they will be caused to change by the change in price, and then their changes will affect the demand. For example, the rise in the price of petrol will, on the one hand, make people buy less petrol (i.e. the demand for petrol drops), but it will also make people buy less cars because one does not need petrol if one does not have a car. Petrol and car are always used together, so the rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to the drop (or rise) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Complements”. The characteristic of complements is that the price of one commodity is inversely related to the demand for the other. The drop in the demand for cars will lead to a drop in the price of cars, which can be explained by the TSD introduced in later lecture and can be understood even with common sense. As car is a supplement to petrol, the drop in the price of cars will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for petrol.

Another example: the rise in the price of pork will, on the one hand, make people buy less pork (i.e. the demand for pork will drop), but people still want to eat meat, so they eat chicken instead. Pork and chicken are substitutable in consumption, so a rise (or drop) in the price of one commodity will lead to a rise (or drop) in the demand for the other commodity. They are called “Substitutes”. The characteristic of substitutes is that the price of one commodity is positively related to the demand for the other. The rise in the demand for chicken will lead to a rise in the price of chicken. As chicken is a substitute to pork, the rise in the price of chicken will in turn lead to a rise in the demand for pork.

As seen from the above two examples, the change in price of a commodity will lead to the change in demand and price of its supplements and substitutes which will in turn affect the demand of this commodity, so they are the “intermediate factors.” Such intermediate factors must be allowed to change. Why? Because there are not only a large number of intermediate factors, but there are also complex and subtle relationships with the goods analyzed. It is difficult to investigate whether they remain unchanged in reality. Take a real example in marketing. There was once a very successful chocolate advertisement in Britain, which attracted many middle school students. It was thought that only the sales of other candies and snacks would be affected because chocolate is obviously a substitute to them. Unexpectedly, even the sales of games dropped dramatically. After investigation, it was found that the pocket money of middle school students was basically a fixed amount, so when they bought more chocolate, they had to cut their spending on games as well as other candies and snacks. Game makers never thought that chocolate would become their competitor. In other words, any two seemingly unrelated commodities in this world will become substitutes or supplements under certain constraints. Therefore, if intermediate factors are not allowed to change, once one finds that the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts, one can always blame on the change of intermediate factors. However, it is difficult to investigate whether intermediate factors have actually changed, thus the law of demand will easily “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.

From the above explanation on the three kinds of other factors, please pay attention to two key points. Firstly, that the first kind of other factors cannot change does not mean that they can really never change, but that they must remain unchanged on the same demand curve. If such other factors have changed in reality, we must draw another new demand curve. This key point has already been stressed before that “ceteris paribus” is an assumption which is not the same as the postulate of “self-interest”. The postulate will never change and is always regarded as true unconditionally. However, the assumption is a prerequisite for the application of a theory, and it may not be true. It is true only when it is consistent with the facts, and then can the theory be applied.

Secondly, as mentioned before, there are other factors such as preference, income, etc. that affect the demand besides price. However, “preference” (as well as taste, like, and other similar expressions) should be specifically singled out. It does affect the demand, but one must assume that it will never change not only on the same demand curve, but also on different demand curves! Why? Because preference is a psychological factor, and not an objective fact that is observable.  If it is allowed to change, again one can always blame on the change of preference whenever the law of demand seems to be refuted by facts. The psychological change is not observable by others, thus the law of demand will again “degenerate” into a tautology without refutability.

Take the previous example of umbrella, with the rise of the price, there are still more umbrellas sold out, which is explained by the change of objective fact (other factors) that the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy one. However, it can also be explained by the change of psychological factor that umbrellas are preferred now than before. Although the effect of these two explanations is the same: to draw another new demand curve (both factors directly affect the demand and cause the whole demand curve move), the former explanation can be tested by looking up to see if it is really raining, but how can the latter explanation be tested? Who knows if umbrellas are more preferred now than before. In fact, it is logically similar to that economics forbids using the postulate of sometimes self-interest and sometimes un-self-interest to explain phenomena.

To extend the above analysis, the statement that a person’s preference remains unchanged is logically equivalent to the statement that different persons have the same preference. In other words, it is forbidden in economics to use different preferences of different persons to explain their different behaviors. It is said that the Mongolian with much less income than Chinese consume much more than Chinese. It is easy to think that it is because the Mongolian and the Chinese have different consumerism, which is not a scientific explanation. Why the Mongolian has the consumerism different from the Chinese is itself a phenomenon that needs to be explained. In brief, such psychological factors as preference habit, custom, nationality and etc. cannot be used to explain phenomena, but are phenomena to be explained. It is objective facts (constraints) behind these factors that can be used to make a refutable explanation.

It is somewhat similar to the previous discussions of expectation and intermediate factor. Intermediate factor is fact, but the change of it is too complicated to investigate, so it is better to let it change. Expectation and preference are the same in that they both belong to psychological factors which are not facts, and they should be replaced by the objective factors (constraints). In other words, the psychological factors are assumed to be unchanged, and it is the objective factors replacing them that change.

Take the previous example of umbrella again. One explanation is that because the weather changes from a sunny day to a rainy day, the whole demand curve for umbrellas moves. Another explanation is that because the umbrellas are preferred more in a rainy day than in a sunny day.  However, preference is a psychological factor. In order to avoid the mistake of tautology, we should further look for objective factors (constraints) that cause this psychology. It is obvious that umbrellas can protect one better from adverse weather in a rainy day (one will get wet in rains without an umbrella, and has a greater chance of getting sick). Rain and illness are objective factors that can be tested by investigating the facts. Thus, the psychological factors that are not facts can be replaced by the logically related objective factors that are facts, and we can avoid the mistake of tautology.

Both of the above explanations are refutable and scientific. Obviously, the latter explanation is too long-winded. Here we introduce more requirements for methodology of science: a scientific theory should be not only refutable, but also the simpler the better. In science, there are also competitions among different theories, and there are two competition criteria to decide which one is the winner. The first criterion is “explanatory power” which means the ability to explain as many phenomena as possible without being refuted by facts). It is the theory with the strongest explanatory power that is the winner. If more than one theory can explain the same amount of phenomena, which means their explanatory powers are the same, now it is the second criterion of “simplicity” decide the winner. It is the simpler theory that is the winner. This second criterion in methodology of science is called “Ockham's Razor” because it was proposed by William of Occam (1287–1347), a logician and Franciscan friar from the 13th to 14th centuries. “Occam’s Razor” says “do not multiply entities without necessity”, while the common expression is “the simpler theory, the better.”

It is necessary to discuss again the competition between Heliocentric and Geocentric in astronomy. In fact, Copernicus did not intend to reject but to improve Geocentric originally. With the development of astronomical observation technology, more and more phenomena that seem to refute Geocentric are discovered, which means Geocentric cannot explain those phenomena. When a theory is refuted by facts, scientists will not immediately abandon it and start to establish a new one, but try to amend and improve the existing theory. Astronomers at that time (including Copernicus) also did so by constantly adding new contents to Geocentric to explain the newly discovered astronomical phenomena. So Geocentric had not really been refuted at that time, but the problem is that it had become more and more complex which was not consistent with “Occam’s Razor”. If there are no other theories that can explain as many astronomical phenomena as it, astronomers can only endure the increasing complexity of Geocentric and continue to accept it. However, Copernicus observed that, unlike the distance between the earth and other stars would change, the distance between the earth and the sun almost never changes. Logically, there are only two possibilities: either the earth is stationary and the sun revolves around it, which is what Geocentric advocates, or the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it. As the Geocentric became more and more complex, Copernicus changed his thinking: What if the sun is stationary and the earth revolves around it? Once this assumption was changed, he found that the explanation of the movements of various stars suddenly became extremely simple -- much simpler than Geocentric! Although all the movements of stars observed at that time could be explained by both Geocentric and Heliocentric, the latter is much simpler, so “Occam’s Razor” cut off Geocentric. In other words, strictly speaking, Geocentric was not refuted by facts in Copernicus era, but replaced by Heliocentric that is simpler with the same (or even stronger) explanatory power. It was not until Galileo's era that the phase of Venus was observed and Geocentric was definitely refuted.

Therefore, it is not a tautology to use preference to explain phenomena if the objective factors that cause preference is further found, but it is better to directly use those objective factors as explanation.

Through the above detailed discussion, it is hoped that the readers have not only learned the specific knowledge about the law of demand, but also further understood the “refutability” and “Occam’s Razor” in methodology of science.
