# Lecture 6: The History of Economic Thinking -- Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

Economics is divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics, which copies the division of physics. Economics has copied many practices in physics which we will meet in the later study. The division of micro and macro is just one of them.
There is macro-physics first, then micro later. Newtonian mechanics belong to macro-physics which is measured in meter. And micro-physics study molecular and atomic levels of matter where the laws of movements are different from those followed by macroscopic objects.

Unlike physics, there is microeconomics first, then macro later. Why is economics also divided into micro and macro? We need to trace back the history of economic thinking.
