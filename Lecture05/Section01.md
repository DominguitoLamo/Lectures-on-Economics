# Section1: Positive economics

Positive economics or “empirical analysis” argues that economic theories are used to explain the phenomena, and answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. Based on the postulate of self-interest, along with the constraints changes, economics explains various kinds of human behaviors. Economics is not responsible for answering such questions as “Is self-interest good?”, “Should human be self-interested?” or “should a person make such a choice?”

As mentioned in Lecture 2, if there is a one-hundred-dollar bill on the ground, it will be blown away by the wind if there is so, which is a phenomenon that can be explained by physics. However, the bill will still disappear in the absence of wind, which is a phenomenon that physics cannot explain, but economics can. The economic explanation for it is: because human is self-interested, if there is no watching over or surveillance camera, which is the constraint, it is sure that someone will take away the bill. Economics is only responsible for answering why someone will take the bill away, but not answering whether he should take it away. Physics is also only responsible for answering why the bill will disappear when there is wind, but not answering whether the wind should blow it away. However, because physics deals with nonliving matter such as wind, physicists are hardly criticized for not answering the latter question. Whereas because economics deals with human behavior, economists are often criticized harshly for not answering such question as to whether particular human behavior is good or bad, which is even blamed bitterly as immoral!

Imagine that someone threw garbage out of a high-rise building and injured a passer-by. Newton came to answer why the garbage fell to the ground instead of flying up to the sky after leaving human’s hand. Smith came to answer why the man threw the garbage out of the building instead of putting it in a trash can. A moralist came to answer whether the man should throw the garbage out of the building.
An economist does not talk about morality, which does not mean he is immoral. As an economist, when he analyzes human behaviors with economic theories, he only needs to answer the question of “to be” instead of “ought to be”. It is morality that is responsible for answering the latter question. It is just the division for different disciplines. Asking an economist to answer whether particular human behavior is good or bad is like asking Newton whether an apple should fall to the ground. To criticize an economist coming to a conclusion you do not like is as ridiculous as to blame an apple which fell from a tree and injured a passer-by, “Damn it! What a bad apple! How can it fell exactly when someone is passing by?”
