# Section 5: The Theory of Supply and Demand with Production

Next we will explain how to deduce the theory of supply and demand with production based on the producer’s optimum. What has been deduced in Lecture 9 is the TSD without production.

Firstly, as shown in Fig.15-3, the demand curve and AR curve are the same line, which is correct no matter in the market structure of price-taking or price-searching, as long as a producer sets a single price for all products. Because $AR = \frac{R}{q}$, when a producer sets a single price for all products, R＝P×q which is put in the previous formula, and get AR＝P. If it is the market structure of price-searching (monopoly), the demand curve sloping downwards reflects how Q changes along with the change in P, while the AR curve reflects how AR (like P) changes along with the change in Q, so they appear to be the same.

Secondly, as shown in Fig.15-4, the part of MC curve above its intersection with ADC curve is the supply curve of a producer. Why? Because a producer will always choose the optimal output according to MR＝MC, the equilibrium point formed by the combination of optimal output (q\*) and price (P) must move along the MC curve with the change in P, which is precisely the same as the supply curve reflecting how Q changes along with the change in P. However, as has pointed out in Lecture 13, once the income from the market falls below the direct cost, a producer will choose to shut down the business, and the output (supply) will drop to 0. Thus, there will be no supply or supply curve below the bottom of ADC curve.
