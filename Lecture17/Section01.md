# Section 1: Information Cost in Society

Strictly speaking, in Robinson’s one-man world, there is also information cost. Robinson needs to know all kinds of knowledge necessary for survival, such as drilling wood to make fire, picking fruits, hunting animals, etc. which are all information costs. Therefore, information cost is not necessary to be transaction cost.

However, once in society, almost all information costs are transaction costs. There is only one case that information cost is not transaction cost in society: different people have incomplete information about something, but there is no information asymmetry among them.

“Incomplete Information” means that people do not have all the relevant information about something. The unknown information makes people unable to make better use of it to obtain more revenue at less cost. The increased cost and reduced revenue simply the information cost. What is more, in order to know more information, people have to spend more costs. For example, in order to know what the weather will be like tomorrow, scientists must first study the principles of meteorology, and then launch meteorological satellites to collect relevant information, which are all huge information costs. According to equal marginal principle, the equilibrium is that people choose to pay more information cost to know more information until the marginal revenue and the marginal cost of knowing more information are equal. It is impossible for people to have complete information, and be always in a state of incomplete information to some extent, because the revenue from the more complete information is not enough to make up for the cost. No matter it is in Robinson’s one-man world or in society, there is incomplete information, so it is not necessary transaction cost.

“Information Asymmetry” means that different people have different information about the same thing. Some of them have more sufficient information than others, and are in a state with relatively complete information. There is a Chinese saying, “A buyer is not as astute as a seller”, which does not mean a buyer is more stupid than a seller, but he usually knows less about the goods than the seller, so the seller can use the information he knows to deceive the buyer, and get more revenue. Obviously, there cannot be information asymmetry in Robinson’s one-man world, so it is transaction cost.

In society, as long as all have the same information about something (there is no information asymmetry), even if they do not have sufficient information (there is incomplete information), all make decisions based on the same information, so all will do the same thing and get the same revenue, where information cost is not transaction cost. However, this condition is too rare, so information cost in society is basically transaction cost.

Information, or some economists such as Hayek use the term of “knowledge”, is as scarce as ordinary goods, so it has a price, and can bring income to those who have it, which means information is an asset. The income of an asset is rent, so the income of information is the information rent which is the same as the rent of a house for the landlord.

Take the information of weather as an example. The ancients did not have the knowledge of meteorology, while agricultural production depended on the weather. In ancient times, if the weather changed suddenly, farmers could do nothing but watched the crops destroyed. By contrast, in modern times, human have the knowledge of meteorology, and the meteorological offices closely monitor the weather changes. The sudden changes of the weather one day later can be forecasted, and the farmers will be notified in time to rush for the harvest. It is information rent that the farmers’ income is higher because they can know the weather change in advance.

Another example is one who pays attention to the weather change can know that it will rain tomorrow, so he buys umbrellas in advance and sells them on the street. He can sell more umbrellas than on sunny days, and even increase the price of. The higher income is also information rent, not because he is lucky and happened to sell umbrellas on the street in rainy days, so it is not unexpected profit. Compared with those who do not pay attention to the weather forecast and do not take umbrellas, he makes money by information asymmetry.

However, information rent is often not as easily to get as the rent of a house. Once an owner of the information tells it to another one, the latter will pretend that he has already known the information and refuse to pay for it. If the owner of information asks the buyer to pay first, it is difficult for the buyer to judge whether the information is worth the price. Information is more difficult to trade than ordinary goods, because the PPR of information is not easy to protect. Once one has known the information, he cannot become unaware. By contrast, an ordinary good can be forcibly returned to the owner if it is illegally taken away. The cost for protection of PPRs is transaction cost in broad sense, so the difficulty in protecting PPR of information means that the transaction cost for protecting PPR of information is higher.

In fact, information is a kind of public good. Public good is characterized by non-exclusive use which means it is difficult to exclude the use of non-owners. Therefore, non-owners can easily infringe the PPR of public good without paying to the owner, which make it difficult to directly trade public goods.

In reality, the way of protection for information is to try to concretize the information into a tangible good, and then the information can be indirectly protected by direct protection for the tangible good. Tangible goods are “private goods” that are easy to prevent infringement by non-owners, which means the transaction cost of protection for PPRs is lower. Therefore, one of the major ways to protect the PPRs of public goods is to tie sale of the public goods and private goods. In fact, the patent laws and intellectual property laws protect the tangible goods concretized from information (technology, knowledge).

In fact, there are also a lot of ways to protect the PPR of information besides laws. For example, the umbrella seller obtains the rent of information about tomorrow’s rain by selling such a tangible good as umbrella. Obviously, only in the case of information asymmetry, one needs to find ways to protect the PPR of information, because those with more complete information need to sell information to those with less information.

There are a lot of people in society who live by earning information rent. The intermediaries are the most typical. They match buyers with sellers by specializing in collecting the information of buyers and sellers. One with work experience is more popular with employers than fresh graduates, and is easier to find a job with better pay. It seems because that the rent of his labor is higher, but actually because he has more sufficient information about the job, which means that his higher rent of labor than that of fresh graduates is actually the information rent. One more example is that the income of teachers is almost entirely information rent. Teachers teach students knowledge, and students pay tuition fees in return for teachers.

Although it is difficult to protect the PPRs of public good, there are still many ways. One way is to tie sale it with a private good which has been pointed out above. The second way is that even if information like knowledge is told directly to the learners, those with limited learning ability cannot master it, so learning ability becomes a natural threshold, effectively excluding a considerable number of people. The third way is indirect charge. For example, the price of TV programs is indirectly charged by advertisements: the audiences do not directly pay for watching the programs, but the advertisers do. After watching the advertisements, the audience is attracted to buy more products from the advertisers, so indirectly pay for the programs. The fourth way is that government supply the public goods (such as national defense) and makes the users to pay through its coercive force.

In MSE, public goods are believed to be only supplied by government or for free, which is obviously wrong according to the above analysis. Even if it is necessary for government to impose fees, it is not necessary for it to provide them. The government can authorize private suppliers to collect fees and provide the public goods. As the saying goes, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Those provided by government for free are actually paid by taxpayers, and government just acts as an intermediary like the advertisers of TV programs. Unless it is a public good generally enjoyed by all taxpayers, such as national defense, those that can only be used by a specific group of people should be paid by users according to the equal marginal principle.
