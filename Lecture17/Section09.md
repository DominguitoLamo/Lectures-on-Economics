# Section 9: SOP is An Irrelevant Answer

The extremely low rate of return is only the superficial problem of SOP, and the deep defect of it lies in the fact that it is an irrelevant answer to the question it is supposed to answer.

Why do people need SOP? Because the problem of providing for the aged needs to be solved. There has been the problem of providing for the aged since ancient times, so why people did not need SOP until now? In ancient times, people also needed to provide for the aged, which is solved by private means, while SOP attempts to solve it by public means. Why should public means take the place of private means? For thousands of years, private means have solved this problem very well. What are the constraints that have changed now, making private means unable to solve this problem, so that government has to implement SOP?

Let us analyze what is the private means first. There are two means to provide for the aged: one is to save money, which means when one is young, he does not spend all the money earned, but save some, and when he becomes old, he provide for himself by the savings. The other is to bring up children, which means when one is young, he brings up children, and when he becomes old, the children have grown up to earn money to provide for him. The latter is an inter-generational provision for the aged.

Then let us turn to analyze the public means. With careful inspection, there are actually also two means imitating private means: one is save money, which means when one is young, he pays premiums that are essentially savings deposited into SOP, and when he becomes old, he provide for himself by pension withdrawn from his own account. The other is also inter-generational provision, which means government collects premiums (social insurance tax) from those who are working (the younger generation) and transfer them to the retired (the older generation).

SOP has not invented any new means different from private means to solve the problem, so what is the meaning of SOP? Or think in another way: private means, which have worked well for thousands of years and successfully solved the problem of provision for the aged of countless generations, what difficulties can they not resolve now so that SOP is needed to resolve? There are only two difficulties: one is due to the improvement of medical and health care, the lifespan of human has greatly lengthened. When one was young, he expected that he would live to 60 years old (because there is a Chinese saying that “A man seldom lives to be 70 years old”), but when he retires, the lifespan has lengthened to 70 years old or even longer. As a result, the money previously saved according to the lifespan of 60 years old is not enough. The other is inflation. Inflation is rare in ancient times, but it has become so common now.[^1] As a result, the money saved when young is eaten away by inflation and is not enough.

Can SOP resolve these two difficulties? Obviously not! Compared with private means, SOP has advantage in two cases: one case is that although some save money prudently, there are still some who squander money casually. The other case is that although some have filial children, there are still some who have no children or have unfilial ones. If there were no SOP, the latter will have no money to provide for the aged and take a miserable life when they are old. With SOP that is compulsory, even those who squander money casually, or have no or unfilial children can at least be provided by SOP when they are old.

However, SOP is supposed not to solve the problem that some squander money casually or have no or unfilial children, but to solve the problem that the purchasing power of savings decreases due to the increase in lifespan and inflation. Some squander money casually or have no or children, which is an unsystematic risk, while the increase in lifespan and the decrease in the purchasing power of savings are systemic risks.

Systematic risk refers to the risk that exists in the whole system, so everyone in it cannot be spared. And unsystematic risk does not exist in the whole system, only some in it will suffer. For example, when one buys stocks, there happens to be a stock market crash. All stocks in the market are falling, so the stocks he buys inevitably also fall, which is a systemic risk. If there is not a stock market crash, only the stocks he mistakenly chooses to buy fall, which is an unsystematic risk. Unsystematic risk stems from personal mistakes, while systematic risk has nothing to do with individuals, and it is a general trend and cannot be dealt with by individuals. Obviously, unsystematic risk does not affect all but only some, so it is not a problem that needs to be worried about and solved by the society or government. By contrast, systematic risk affects all, and cannot be dealt with by individuals, so it needs to be worried about and solved by the society or government.

In a word, SOP is supposed to solve the problem of systematic risk, but it is an irrelevant answer to it by solving the problem of unsystematic risk! The extremely low rate of return of SOP means it does not answer the question correctly. SOP has not solved the problem of systematic risk including the increase in lifespan and the decrease in the purchasing power of savings, but has only solved the problem of unsystematic risk that some do not save money or have no or unfilial children, which means it does not answer the correct question. For the students who do not answer the question correctly, they can be given some credit. For the students who do not answer the correct question, they can be only given a zero.

As mentioned before, if the money in one’s investment (savings) account is used to pay another’s investment return, the investment (savings) project has essentially become a Ponzi scheme. Although the children’s money is also used to provide their parents in private means, it is blood relationship that can clearly define the PPRs of diverting fund. It is quite different from diverting the premium paid by the younger generation to provide the aged of older generation in SOP, because the younger generation does not know how much their money is diverted to the older generation, and they may not be willing to provide for the aged except their own parents.

Some may argue that as long as SOP only applies the mode of self-support that the money in one’s social security account can only be used to pay his own pension, and diversion of money is strictly forbidden, it will not become Ponzi’s scheme. However, precisely because SOP has failed to solve the problem of systematic risk, it has to continue to face the difficulty that the money (premium) previously saved will be not enough to provide the aged when the insured becomes old. Along with the inefficiency of administrative monopoly, the rate of return of SOP must be negative in the long run, so the money in one’s social security account cannot be sufficient to pay the pension promised by government. In order to prevent SOP from going bankrupt, government either diverts the money from the social security accounts of the younger generation, or injects fiscal funds into SOP. The former directly changes SOP from the mode of self-support to inter-generational provision, which makes SOP become Ponzi’s scheme. The latter also indirectly does so, because fiscal funds come from taxes, and the major group of taxpayers is, of course, the young generation that is working.

What is more troublesome is that once SOP changes to the mode of inter-generational provision, it will be difficult to abolish it. If government suddenly announces that SOP has an extremely low rate of return, swallows up a large amount of fiscal fund, and is unsustainable, so let it go bankrupt, which is actually a wise decision as a Chinese’s saying “to cut one’s arm to save one’s body”. At least it can save the whole society from endlessly continuing to input money into the bottomless black hole. However, how can this decision be approved by the public? The aged who are enjoying the benefits from SOP will not agree, while the young who have been paying to support it and never enjoyed any benefits will neither agree. Although the young may know clearly that SOP will go bankrupt sooner or later, they are of course self-interested in thinking that even if SOP will go bankrupt, it should do so after they have enjoyed it! That is why the SOPs in all nations are dying, but they do not go bankrupt until the day when the last dollar of the national treasury (even the whole society) is used up. Actually, from the perspective of the whole society, the optimal solution is to let SOP go bankrupt as soon as possible, and return the money left to the public who can go back for private means. It is a proof of the harm of self-interest again.

In fact, one of the true causes of European sovereign debt crisis is not the financial turmoil of 2008, but the huge burden of SOP. As early as before 2008, the governments of many European countries had realized that the bankruptcy of SOP was imminent, but they estimated the time of bankruptcy would be in the middle of the 21st century. Unexpectedly, the financial turmoil of 2008 made the governments spend more money to cope with the crisis, which greatly sped up the progress of the bankruptcy of SOP. The French administration passed a bill to postpone the retirement age, which only delays the time bomb instead of disassembling it. In spite of this, the passage of the bill took a lot of time and caused strong opposition from the public. When the treasury is completely empty, and no matter how the public cries or scolds, the government is still unable to take money out of thin air. Then it is the end of SOP.

As mentioned before, the systematic risk cannot be solved by individuals. However, in reality, private means can deal with the two systematic risks to some extent. As for the increase in lifespan, do not forget that the improvement in medical and health care not only prolongs human’s lifespan, but also prolongs the time when one is healthy and fit to continue working. Since lifespan is prolonged and there is not enough money, one can continue to work to earn more money. As long as there is no mandatory retirement age, people will make appropriate choices to solve this problem. It is precisely the implementation of SOP that encourages the aged who are still able to work and live on their own to choose to retire waiting for the provision, and prevents people from making appropriate responses to the change in lifespan.

As for inflation, it is the responsibility of the government, because inflation is caused by it. However, the solution to inflation is not SOP, an irrelevant answer, but monetary policy that controls the money supply, which will be explained in the later lecture of “Monetary Theory”. In fact, individuals can also do something to deal with the problem of inflation, such as savings on the assets (like real estate) with floating revenue and against inflation.

Even as for the unsystematic risks that can be effectively solved by SOP, it is better not to use such coercive means. Since the ancient times, there has been morality that advocates one should be thrifty and filial to parents, which is how a society solves such unsystematic risks. And private charity will also be used to take care of those who have no money or children to provide for the aged. Although morality and charity are not as powerful as SOP in solving these unsystematic risks, neither have they negative effects as SOP.

What are the negative effects of SOP? It is not only a huge fiscal burden for a nation as has been analyzed above, but also seriously corrupts the traditional morality. When there is SOP, one will become less willing to save money and keep a good relationship with his parents and children, because the value of doing so decreases, which is only the implication of the law of demand. It is well-known that the westerners do not like to save money as the easterners, and family values, especially the moral values of filial piety, are much weaker in western countries. But it is not well-known that the long-term implementation of SOP is one of the main culprits. Indeed, the SOP has only been implemented in China for a few years, there have been phenomena that it has begun to shake and weaken the traditional morality and family relationship in China.
