# Section 2: The Behaviors Reducing Information Cost

Since information cost is a kind of cost, human is motivated to reduce it due to the nature of self-interest.

As mentioned in Lecture 8, the strategy of “judging quality by price” implies that the information of price is lower than that of quality, so it is a typical behavior reducing information cost. In fact, Of course, the information cost involved in the strategy of judging quality by price is not just that of price, but also including to the risk of making mistakes because risk is also a kind of information cost, which will explained later in this lecture.

The purpose of advertising is also to reduce information cost. There are two functions of advertising. One is to tell consumers directly about the product’s information: what is the performance, where is it sold, what is the price, etc. The other is to establish brand. Why should a producer establish brand? As has been discussed in Lecture 16, a producer establish brand to establish entry threshold. Strictly speaking, the entry threshold is not formed by brand, but by higher quality. Brand can make consumers easily recognize that it is a high-quality product, which means it can reduce information cost.

The Soviet Union once forbade producers to use trademarks, resulting in a sharp drop in product quality. Without a trademark (the visualization of brand), consumers cannot distinguish similar products of different producers, because they are not professionals of various products and cannot judge the quality from the appearance. Thus, producers tend to reduce the quality that cannot be judged from the appearance to reduce production cost without.

Attention: many behaviors of businesses in reality seem to be quite different from advertising (such as the advertisements on mass media like newspapers, radio, television, internet), but the essence of them are actually advertising.

For example, the fancies of iPhone will rush to queue up to buy the new products, which will even attract scalpers. As pointed out in Lecture 9, price control imposed by government will lead to queuing because the price criterion are taken place by the non-price criterion of fire-come-first-served. It is a waste (rent dissipation) for buyers waiting in line doing nothing. However, this analysis cannot be applied mechanically and rigidly to the queuing of buying iPhone. There is queuing up, which implies that the price of iPhone must be lower than equilibrium. But no government imposes price control on iPhone, and the Apple Inc. is voluntary to charge a lower price.

Why does the Apple Inc. not raise the price to eliminate the queuing and turn the rent dissipation caused by queuing to its revenue? In fact, it is a behavior of advertising. The less revenue because of lower price is not a waste, but advertising expense, the effect of which is much better than the direct advertisement on mass media. The craziness of fancies of iPhone and the scalpers are widely reported as news instead of advertisement, and people believe news but may not believe advertisement. They discuss how popular the new iPhone is on major online portals and forums such as Weibo, unknowingly help to propaganda the new iPhone. The wide coverage and strong penetration are far better than the traditional advertisement, because the audiences are unconsciously attracted to actively participate in the event of marketing. This strategy of Apple Inc. is concluded as “hungry marketing” by deliberately charging the price lower than equilibrium.

There is also another example. When a new product is launching on the market, the price is often charged lower, sometimes so low that it is even lower than the direct cost. In MSE, it is believed to be “Predatory Dumping”, a kind of monopolization by eliminating the original producers in the market, and raising the price to higher monopolistic price to cover the previous loss when the new producer has become the only one in the market or a monopolist. However, as has been criticized in Lecture 16, whether the market structure is monopoly depends not on the number of producers in the market, but on whether there is entry threshold. If a new producer drives out the original producers by charging a price lower than direct cost without establishing any entry threshold, he is foolish to think that the original producers who have left will not enter the market again when he raise the price to higher monopolistic price. Therefore, the so-called predatory dumping is again a myth.

Then why does a new producer charge the price lower than the direct cost? Because it is again a behavior of advertising. A new product is not well known to consumers, so it needs to be sold at an ultra-low price (sometimes even for free) to attract consumers’ attention and encourage them to try it to experience the function and performance of it, which is much better than direct advertisement on mass media. Consumers who will buy it or get it for free are usually the target customers of the product. The loss caused by charging a price lower than the direct cost is equivalent to the advertising expense, but it is a much more accurate marketing than traditional advertisement.

In conclusion, there are a large number of cases about artful advertisement in marketing and advertising. There seems to be waste or loss which in fact is advertising expense and is better to reduce information cost of making consumers know the products or the brands.

Thus, the purpose of advertising is to reduce the information cost of consumers, and it is the product quality that can really establish the entry threshold. Although there is always false publicity, the true information will spread out, and the information cost will gradually decrease at last. If a product without good quality is only advertised by cheating consumers, which means the advertisement does not reduce but increase the information cost of consumers, or the entry threshold is established by information cost instead of product quality, the information rent will be dissipated by the market competition sooner or later.

The case of “Qin-chi”, a brand of Chinese liquor, is a typical negative example. Qin-chi became the bid winner of CCTV in 1996 and 1997. In 1996, the winning bid price is 66.66 million, and in 1997, it soared to the sky-high price of 320 million. Initially, it had wined a great reputation and outstanding achievements within one year, and became famous in the whole country of China. In 1996, the sales volume increased by more than 500%, and the profit margin increased by more than 600%, but the production capacity finally reached the limit, and could not keep up with the rapid expansion in 1997. Then it purchased other liquor in Sichuan Province to blend with its liquor, which is in fact at the cost of reducing the quality. The public had doubted how Qin-chi could bear such a huge amount of advertising expense, so news media soon dig into the fact and exposed this blending practice. Since then, the situation had taken a sharp turn for the worse. In 1997, the sales volume dropped 300 million compared with that in 1996, and the profit and tax fell 60 million. In the first four months of 1998, the sales volume further dropped 50 million. The brilliant performance turned into a bubble that burst in a flash.
