# Section 1: Opportunity Cost

In this lecture, we will introduce one of the most important concepts in economics: cost.

Please think about the following questions: What is the cost of a student going to university?  Firstly, he has to pay tuition. Anything else? Yes! In addition to tuition, he also has to give up the income from working.

The cost in economics or economic cost is different from that used in daily life which refers to accounting cost, historical cost or monetary expenditure. However, the economic cost refers to the highest income given up. That is why it is called “opportunity cost” which means that cost is the highest income among the opportunities given up.

Next, a numerical example will be used to illustrate the concept of opportunity cost. As shown in table 11-1 below, suppose there are two options A and B, and the income of option A is 100, while the income of option B is 200. What are the costs of these two options respectively? According to the concept of opportunity cost introduced above, the cost of A is the income of B which is 200, while the cost of B is the income of A which is 100.

|| Income | Cost |
|----|----|----|
| A |100|200|
|B|200|100|

Suppose there is more option C with the income of 300 as shown in Table 11-2. What are the costs of A, B and C? If one chooses A, he gives up B and C, but which has the highest income? It is C, so the income of C instead of B is the cost, and the cost of A is 300. Similarly, the cost of B is also the income of C which is 300. What about the cost of C? If one chooses C by giving up A and B, the income of B is the highest among A and B, so the cost of C is 200.

|| Income | Cost |
|----|----|----|
|A|100|300|
|B|200|300|
|C|300|200|

Table 11-2

It is clear that the highest income given up is the cost. As long as the highest income remains unchanged, the cost will also remain unchanged no matter how the incomes of other options (including the income of the option chosen) change.

Caution: The cost of C is not the sum of the incomes of A and B, but the one with higher income. However, if one option can only be chosen by giving up multiple options, the incomes of them must be summed up. For example, what is the cost for a student to go to university? On the one hand, he has given up some money for paying tuition. Attention: tuition is cost, not because the student has spent money, but because he has given up the option of using the money to buy other goods. In other words, he has given up the use value of consuming other goods, and it is also a kind of non-monetary income which is the cost of going to university. Cost must be seen from the perspective of giving up income, not from the perspective of expenditure, otherwise it will be confused with the concept of accounting cost or historical cost. On the other hand, the student has also given up the income of working. The student must give up these two options at the same time to go to university, so both incomes must be summed up. It is different from the numerical example in Table 11.2 where if A is chosen, B cannot be chosen, so only the higher income of B is the cost of C.

One does not need study economics to know that he should choose the option with the least cost. However, one needs to study economics to know that he should not choose according to (accounting) cost in daily life, but according to opportunity cost. For example, why are there more customers going to barbershop on weekends than on weekdays. The price of haircut is the same on weekdays as on weekends. If one chooses when to have a haircut according to the cost or expenditure in daily life, weekdays should be the same as weekends. The answer is: because people choose when to have a haircut according to the opportunity cost. If one goes to barbershop on weekdays, he not only gives up the money paying for the haircut, but also the income of working. By contrast, if he goes to barbershop on weekends, he does not need to give up the income of working. Therefore, the opportunity cost of haircut on weekends is actually lower than on weekdays. It is the law of demand that determines more people will choose to go to barbershop on weekends with lower cost! What is more, it is opportunity cost instead of only the price paid for a haircut that is the variable of price in the demand curve.
