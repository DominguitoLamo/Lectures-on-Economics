# Section 2: Historical Cost is not Cost

There are some key points for opportunity cost.

Firstly, there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Because cost is the highest income of the option that has been given up, if there is no alternative option, there will be no income that has been given up and no cost at all.

Secondly, historical cost is not cost. The historical cost is the expenditure that has already been paid and has become history. Why is it not cost? The reason lies in the first key point above: there is no cost if there is no alternative option. Without time machine, human had not the option of go backing to the past to choose once again. Therefore, the expenditure that has already paid is like the water that has poured out, and it cannot affect the current choice.[^1]

It is very important that historical cost is not cost, especially when making decisions in investment. Those who do not know or forget this key point will make mistakes. Suppose one has bought a stock at the price level of RMB100, and now the price falls to RMB80, should he sell the stock? He should not consider that historical cost of RMB100, but just consider whether the stock is expected to fall or rise in the future. If he expects the price of the stock will continue to fall, for example, to RMB50, the income and cost of his options is as follows:

|| Income | Cost |
|----|----|----|
| A：Sell out |80|50|
| B：Not sell |50|80|

Next, a real example will be used to illustrate how to apply the concept of opportunity cost: SARS!

In the spring of 2003, SARS broke out in China. This disease spread by close droplets transmission, so wearing masks is considered to be the most effective preventive measure. As a result, the public rushed to buy mask. The price of mask soared, causing public criticism. The stores of mask sellers were believed to have been bought in before the outbreak of SARS, and the prices then were very low. The sellers who raised the price of mask were criticized as looting a burning house and even making a fortune on nation’s trouble, and government was appealed to crack down on this so-called illegal price behavior.

Three economic questions can be made out on the price rise of mask during SARS:

(1) Even the price of mask has soared, but the demand for mask still dramatically increased. Has it refuted the law of demand?

(2) Suppose the price of mask before SARS was RMB1, and rose to RMB10 during SARS. Why did it happen? In other words, why did the suppliers sell out the masks at RMB10 instead of the stock price of RMB1? Cautious: do not ask whether mask suppliers are bad guys or whether they should raise the price of mask or not? It is economic question, not moral criticism.

(3) What would happen if government, influenced by public opinion, imposed price control prohibiting mask suppliers from raising the price?

Only the Question (2) will be explained here.

The masks bought before SARS were purchased at the price of RMB1 which was historical cost, not opportunity cost. What is the opportunity cost of the masks during SARS? Just with a look at the market of mask, anyone could see even if the price was raised to RMB10, the masks would be still sold out. Therefore, the options faced by a mask supplier were as follows:

|| Income | Cost |
|----|----|----|
| A：1RMB |1|10|
| B：10RMB |10|1|

Table 11-4

If the mask supplier continued to sell at the price of RMB1 as before SARS, his mask could be all sold out, and his income per mask would be RMB1. If he raised the price to RMB10, his mask could still be sold out due to the huge demand in the market during SARS, and his income per mask would be RMB10. According to the concept of opportunity cost, the cost of A is the income of B which is RMB10, while the cost of B cost is the income of A which is RMB1. It is easy to predict that the self-interested suppliers would choose B for cost minimization. Attention: In the absence of SARS, mask suppliers could not sell out the masks at RMB10, because there would not be so huge demand for the mask or there was so high use value of mask in preventing the transmission of SARS. Without SARS, the income of B is only 0, not 10, so the cost of A is also 0, and the self-interested suppliers will choose A instead of B for cost minimization.

It is obvious that opportunity cost can well explain the mask suppliers’ behaviors no matter with SARS or without SARS. Especially during SARS, why would the mask suppliers set the price different from the purchase cost (historical cost) could not be explained by historical cost, but well explained by opportunity cost. In other words, the rise in price of mask during SARS has also proved eloquently that it is not the historical cost but the opportunity cost that determines human’s behavior. It is precisely why in economics the concept of opportunity cost must take the place of the accounting cost or historical cost commonly used in daily life. It is not because economists like to be different, but because historical cost cannot explain the phenomena in reality, while opportunity cost can.
