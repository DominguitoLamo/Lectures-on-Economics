# Section 3: The Explanation of Producers’ Behaviors with Overhead Cost

The concept of overhead cost is very important because it can explain many producers’ behaviors.

Firstly, it is overhead cost that determines the shutdown decision of producers.
As can be seen from the analysis in the previous section, even if income (RMB900) is lower than expectation (RMB1000), producers will not choose to shutdown, unless income falls so low that it cannot cover direct cost (RMB200). In other words, whether producers stay in the market and continue the business depends on overhead cost.

In reality, income always fluctuates, but producers will not shutdown the business frequently. As long as one expects income will not decline to be lower than direct cost, he will stay in the market, and what he loses is part overhead cost, which is the “pain” he can bear. However, once income drops to lower than direct cost, producers will shut down immediately.[^1] For an analogy, direct cost is like bone, while overhead cost is like fat. Producers experience economic recession just as animals experience winter. The thicker the fat (the higher the overhead cost), the longer animals can survive (the longer producers can survive). And once the knife cuts into the bone (income falls to be lower than direct cost), animals will die (producers will shut down business or be knocked out of the market).

Secondly, logically deduced from the first key point, in order not to be knocked out of the market, producers must try to maximize overhead cost. The zero-profit theorem mentioned in the previous section determines that producers actually cannot have profit. In MSE, it is said that what producers try to maximize is profit, which is completely wrong and again is a big mistake of MSE.

It sounds ridiculous that the target of producers is overhead cost maximization, because cost seems to ought to be minimized. However, the essence of overhead cost is rent, and rent maximization is rather reasonable. To be precise, the “cost” in cost minimization should refer to direct cost, not overhead cost. As mentioned in Lecture 12, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost. If cost minimization means that all costs are minimized, is it not similar to income minimization? Obviously, it is not correct. In order to survive the fierce and cruel market competition, producers must strive for as much overhead cost as possible to protect them. Ceteris Paribus, producers with higher overhead cost can survive longer in economic or industrial recession with income declining.

To increase overhead cost, there are two directions: one is to reduce direct cost as much as possible, and the other is to increase income as much as possible, which is subject to competition constraints from other rivals in the market and out of the market who intend to enter the market at any time.

There are many behaviors of producers to increase overhead cost. For example, why does a firm spend a lot of money on R&D (Research and Development) and innovation which increase cost? Because there are two functions for technology: one is to reduce production cost which is direct cost, so that producers can get higher profit (actually overhead cost) with the same price (income). The other is to improve the quality of products, so that consumers are willing to buy even with higher price. Thus the money invested in R&D is used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of technology.

Why does a firm pay high salary to employ an able executive? Because an able executive is either a cost-killer who can drastically cut cost (direct cost, or a marketing expert who can greatly increase the sales of products in the market. Thus the money paid to hire an able executive is also used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of human capital of the able executive.

Why does a firm spend a lot of money on advertisement to build brand? Because the essence of brand is to reduce the information cost of consumers on the quality of the products, so that consumers are willing to buy brand-name products even with higher price. Thus the money invested in building brand is also used to increase overhead cost which here is the rent of brand.

Thirdly, overhead cost can protect producers from being knocked out of the market by competition, while market competition can in turn protect overhead cost. The income that producers can get from selling the whole business is the direct cost of those who are still outside the market and intend to enter. As long as there are outsiders who intend to enter the market at any time, one of their options is to directly purchase the whole business transferred by insiders. Therefore, these outsiders who compete to enter the market have objectively protected the overhead cost of insiders from falling to zero. Competition will dissipate profit, but will protect rent which is overhead cost. Precisely speaking, the competition among the outsiders to enter the market can protect the overhead cost of insiders which will in turn protect the insiders from being knocked out of the market. The direct cost of insiders is naturally lower than that of outsiders, so the insiders have the advantage of cost in the competition with outsiders.

How does market competition protect the overhead cost? There are two aspects. Suppose one has store, and per month the income is RMB12,000, the direct cost of water, electricity, labor, etc. is RMB2,000, so the overhead cost is RMB10,000 which is the rent of the whole business. Theoretically, once entering the market, one will not choose to shutdown unless the income falls to be lower than RMB2,000, as shown in Table 13-2.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Shutdown|0|10000|-10000|
|B：No Shutdown|12,000－2,000|0|10000|

However, why does the income fall? The analysis in detail indicates two different possibilities.

One possibility is that the insider is poor in doing business, and the income is less than RMB 12,000 which is common for other insiders. Suppose his income is only RMB10,000, which causes his overhead cost to fall to RMB8,000. Theoretically, he will continue to do business in the market, because there is still overhead cost. As long as the income does not drop to be lower than RMB2,000 or the overhead cost does not drop to 0, it is the “pain” he can bear.

Really? No! Outsiders will find it profitable to offer this insider a price of not less than RMB8,000 but not more than RMB10,000 to buy the whole business (the store). Suppose an outsider offer RMB9,000. Will the insider accept it? Yes! Because now his options become that shown in table 13-3:

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Shutdown|9000|8000|1000|
|B：No Shutdown|10,000－2,000|9000|-1000|

<div align="center">
Table 13-3
</div>

Attention: now the income of “Shutdown” is no longer 0, because the insider can get RMB9,000 by selling the store to the outsider when he chooses to shutdown, which leads to an increase in the opportunity cost of “No Shutdown”, and he becomes inclined to choose to shut down. If the income of “Shutdown” is adjusted to 0 so as to be comparable with the data in table 13-2, it is shown in table 13-4. It is clear that the competition from outsiders has changed part of the overhead cost of the insider to direct cost, so the overhead cost have decreased, which makes the insider tend to choose to shut down.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Shutdown|0|-1000|1000|
|B：No Shutdown|10,000－2,000－9,000|0|-1000|

<div align="center">
Table 13-4

What is more, the overhead cost of the insider has decreased, but after the outsider have entered the market by buying the store from the insider, the overhead cost of the store will rise back to RMB10,000 (＝12,000－2000). In other words, market competition has protected the overhead cost of the store from falling to RMB8,000 or even to the theoretical minimum of 0 caused by the poor performance of insider.

This numerical example clearly shows how the market competition protects overhead cost of the store from being lower than the normal level of the whole industry, and allocates resources to the most efficient producers by the survival of the fittest. For the insider, he has made the optimal choice by selling the store to the outsider, because he can get RMB9,000 which is more than RMB8,000 if he chooses to continue the business. For the whole industry, this insider with poor performance has been knocked out of the market by the outsider, and the resource of the store has been transferred from the less efficient insider to the more efficient outsider through price competition. It ensures the most effective use of the resource, and protects the overhead cost (i.e. the rent or the value) of the resource.

It is even clearer if we observe public companies in the stock market. If the performance of the CEO in a public company is so poor that the stock price drop dramatically, outsiders will buy the stocks in large quantities. When they can control the company, they will enter the board of directors and fire the incompetent CEO, thus protecting the equity (overhead cost) from falling to 0 or even going bankrupt.

The other possibility of income decline is that the business environment of the whole industry is worsening, which is not the problem of a certain producer’s poor performance. Suppose the income of all producers generally drops from RMB12,000 to RMB10,000, causing the overhead cost of insiders to drop from RMB10,000 to RMB8,000. Now there will be no outsiders who are attracted to enter the market, because they also expect to get only RMB10,000 instead of RMB12,000. For outsiders, all costs are direct costs which are RMB10,000, while the direct costs of insiders are only RMB2,000 which are much lower, so outsiders cannot compete with insiders. In other words, with the same other factors (such as the ability of doing business), the direct cost of insider is lower than outsider because outsider does not have overhead cost and all costs are direct costs. Thus insiders are protected by overhead cost and free from outsiders’ competition before the income falls to be lower than overhead cost.

In brief, the competition of outsider' entering the market protects the overhead cost of the assets held by insiders, which in turn protects insiders from the competition of outsiders. Of course, the premise of the protection is that insiders are not less competitive than outsiders. In other words, the competitiveness of an insider is precisely reflected in the overhead cost of the assets he holds. The more competitive he is, the higher the overhead cost of his assets, and the harder it is for outsiders to enter the market to compete with him and knock him out.

What is more, the income decline of the whole industry may be due to other reasons except for the economic recession. For example, there may be technological progress or other factors that leads to the decline in production cost or transaction cost. There are also two possibilities.

One possibility is that new industry is emerging, which is a perfect substitute for the old industry, and more competitive than the old one. The old industry may be replaced or even completely eliminated by the new industry. The most typical example is digital camera replacing film camera. In fact, it is logically similar to an insider with poor performance is replaced by a more competitive outsider. Therefore, when the income of the old industry decline, market competition will not protect the overhead cost of it, but will protect the overhead cost of the whole economy! Market competition will replace the overhead cost of the old industry with that of the new industry to ensure that the overhead cost of the whole economy is protected. It is similar to the previous analysis of market competition which replaces the poor-performed insider (equivalent to the old industry) with the competent outsider (equivalent to the new industry) to protect the overhead cost of the store (equivalent to the whole economy).

The other possibility is that some factors (such as technological progress) lead to a drop in production cost or transaction cost which is the entry threshold of an industry, resulting in a drop in the cost of entry for outsiders. The entry threshold is part of the overhead cost of insiders, which is monopolistic rent, so the lower threshold will cause the overhead cost of insiders to fall.

One of the typical examples is the development of microfilm. In the past, movie-making required high technology and much capital, which means that the entry threshold of the movie industry was very high. However, the progress of Internet technology has given birth to microfilm, of which the requirement of technology and capital for making movie is much lower than before. Many directors are indignant, because they used to spend a lot of energy and money on movie-making, while young people now can easily make microfilm. They accuse the microfilm of being too low in threshold and chaotic. They had spent a lot of money when they entered the movie industry. The cost they had paid is historical cost, and has converted to overhead cost which is covered by the high price of their products (movies) due to the high entry threshold keeping outsiders away. Now young people can easily make microfilm, which means the entry threshold for outsiders has been greatly reduced, resulting in a significant drop in the overhead cost of senior directors.

It is profit dissipation caused by fiercer market competition, which seems somewhat similar to rent dissipation. Rent dissipation is due to infringement of PPRs, while profit dissipation is due to the factor change (such as technological progress) causing the monopolistic rent turn to profit which will be surely dissipated by market competition. When the entry threshold or monopoly of an industry declines and competition becomes fiercer, the overhead cost originally protected by the threshold will be turned to profit without protection and dissipated by competition.[^2]

No matter what will the factor change cause, or no matter whether market competition protects the overhead cost of an industry or dissipates the profit (turned from previous overhead cost) of it, it must be good to the economy as a whole. Because even if the profit of insiders is dissipated, it is different from the rent dissipation due to infringement of PPRs, but benefits consumers through price reduction, which means the previous overhead cost of insiders is converted into consumer surplus, a concept to be introduced in the later lecture “Price-searching”. Thus, from the perspective of the whole economy, market competition does not dissipate overhead cost, but converts them into consumer surplus. Market competition still protects the rent of the whole economy in the way that the rent of the whole economy now is not in the form of producer surplus (overhead cost), but consumer surplus.

Fourthly, the size of overhead cost also affects the quality of product, which is determined by “the Principle of Rent Matching”. It is a theory with wide application and strong explanatory power, which will be introduced in detail in the next section.

[^1]: In MSE, the shutdown decision is analyzed with the wrong concepts of short-run, long-run and fixed cost.

[^2]: The factor change (such as technological progress) leading to decrease entry threshold may be bad to insiders, but may also be good. A decline in monopoly in an industry will lead to an increase in the supply, then resulting in a decline in price, and demand will rise according to the law of demand. If the scale of the whole industry remains unchanged or just increases little, insiders must suffer from the decreasing overhead cost. However, if the demand rises dramatically, so the scale of the whole industry grows significantly, the income of insiders will increase instead. The development of automobile industry after China’s entry to the WTO is a typical example. Therefore, the factor change such as technological progress or liberalization of entry control which will lower the threshold or monopoly is not necessary to dissipate the overhead cost of insiders. The final effect depends on the change in the overhead cost of the whole industry.
