# Section 2: Direct Cost and Overhead Cost

Abandoning the concepts of short-run and long-run, and facing the reality where there is transaction cost, how should we analyze the cost of production? A more objective criterion can be used to divide it into two kinds: one is the cost when there is output and it changes along with the change of output, which is called “direct cost” (DC), and is equivalent to variable cost in MSE. The other is the cost even when there is no output, which is called “overhead cost” (OC), but it is different from fixed cost in MSE.

There are three statements about overhead cost. (1) The definition of overhead cost is: when producers choose to continue to do business, the cost that they have to bear even without production is called overhead cost. (2) The calculation formula of overhead cost is: income－direct cost. (3) The essence of overhead cost is: the asset value of the whole business, i.e. the rent. These three statements can be deduced from each other. The following is an example of a training agency.

Suppose one is considering whether to do the business of a training agency. For the sake of simplicity, suppose there are only two production factors needed: rooms for classrooms and electricity. Labor (including the boss, recruiters, and teachers, etc.) is excluded here because it is a very complex production factor, the cost of which is not easy to distinguished as direct cost or overhead cost. Therefore, although it is impossible not to use labor in any production, in order to prevent beginners from confusing, let us simplify the assumption to so unrealistic first. Later, we will extend the assumption to more realistic.

Firstly, one investigates the market and finds that once he enters the market of training agency, only when there are courses, there will be the cost of electricity, because he turns on the lights and computers during a course, and can turn off them if there is no course to avoid such costs. Thus, electricity charge is the direct cost after entering the market. Suppose according to the investigation, if there are courses every night, per month the income is RMB1000, the electricity charge will be RMB200, and the rent for the classrooms is RMB800. In other words, income can cover all costs, so he decides to enter the market.

Someone may ask: income only covers all costs, which means there is no profit, why will one choose to enter the market? If one does not enter a market unless there is profit, in fact there are other production factors such as labor, capital, etc. The so-called profit is used to cover the cost of these other production factors. As mentioned in Lecture12, one who works for himself and use his own money also needs to pay wage and interest for himself, so the profit is actually not profit, but just the wage and interest paid to cover the cost of his own labor and money. And in the example of training agency here, for the sake of simplicity, it is supposed only two production factors (room and electricity) are needed. In other words, other production factors including the labor and money of the boss himself are assumed not to be needed or to be free, so he does not need so-called profit to cover all these costs. It is called zero-profit theorem in economics which will be introduced in the later lecture.

Before entering the market, all costs (rent of classrooms and electricity charge) are direct costs, because one can choose not to enter, and does not need to bear these costs, which means there will be no such cost if there is no production.

And then, one has paid the rent of classrooms for one year, and the cost equivalent to RMB800 a month will immediately become historical cost. In principle, after entering the market, as long as the income from the market is higher than the direct cost of electricity (RMB200), one will continue to do business, because the rent of RMB800 has become historical cost which should not affect his behavior. However, if one expects the income from the market only more than RMB200 but less than RMB1000 before entering the market, he will not choose to enter, because at that time, the rent of RMB800 is still direct cost, not historical cost.

After entering the market, one may find the income of tuition is RMB1000 as expected. After deducting the electricity charge of RMB200, the net income is RMB800 which can cover the rent paid when entering the market. This net income is precisely overhead cost according to the calculation formula of “overhead cost＝income－direct cost”. It seems that overhead cost is the same as fixed cost which is historical cost paid when entering the market, but it is only equal in value and completely different in essence. The essence of fixed cost is historical cost, not (opportunity) cost, while the essence of overhead cost is rent which is (opportunity) cost.

Why? Suppose that one night there is no course for some reason, one will turn off the lights and the computers to save the direct cost of electricity. But how about the cost of the classrooms? Regardless of the relevant transaction cost, theoretically one can choose to sublet the unused classrooms on that night, and the rent he gets is the opportunity cost of the classrooms. Thus, the rent of subletting the classrooms is the cost even when there is no production (the rooms are unused), which is the overhead cost.

The question is: how much will someone else be willing to offer to rent the rooms? The answer is: it must be equivalent to RMB800/30 days, because it is only one night’s rent and RMB800 is the rent of a month. The rent someone else is willing to pay cannot be higher than the income from using the rooms. Suppose someone else also uses the rooms as classrooms for training agency, exactly the same as the lessor. The rooms have been arranged to be suitable as classrooms for training agency, so it is better to use them in the same way, otherwise there will be additional cost. In other words, the option consistent with income maximization or cost minimization is to use the rooms in the same way as the lessor, which is to use them as the classrooms for training agency. Since the rooms are used in the same way, the income must be also the same, which is equivalent to RMB800/30 days or the difference of income (RMB1000) and direct cost of electricity charge (RMB200).

Thus, the concept of overhead cost is consistent with the calculation formula. When there is no output, the income from transferring an idle asset is the opportunity cost of not transferring it. And the price at which someone else is willing to buy it is the indifference between the income the lessee can get and the direct cost. Since the best way for the lessee to use the asset in the same way as the lessor, his income is also the same as that of the lessor. Therefore, the overhead cost of the asset is the difference between the income and the direct cost.

Caution: income, direct cost and overhead cost are all expected value, not actual one. If it has happened, it has become history. Take the business of training agency as example, when one has got RMB1000 as the income, and has paid RMB200 as the electricity charge, so has earned 800RMB as the net income which can make up for the rent of the rooms in the first month, all of these are no longer (expected) income, (expected) direct cost and (expected) overhead cost. Now one needs to estimate the income and electricity charge of the next month. The business in the first month has strengthened his expectation, so he will continue to expect the income of the next month to be also RMB1000, the electricity charge RMB200, and the net income RMB800, all of which are (expected) income, (expected) direct cost and (expected) overhead cost.

As mentioned earlier, overhead cost appears to be equal in value to fixed cost (historical cost) just when the expectation is correct. If the expectation is incorrect, overhead cost will be no longer equal to fixed cost. For example, suppose the income in the first month is RMB900 instead of RMB1000, and the electricity charge is still RMB200, so the net income becomes RMB700. The actual income (RMB900) is lower than the expectation (RMB1000), so there is RMB100 of (negative) profit which is unexpected (negative) income.

Now one still needs to estimate the income and electricity charge of the next month. If he thinks that the loss of RMB100 in this month is just an accidental loss which will not last in the next month, he will continue to expect the income of the next month to be also RMB1000, the electricity charge RMB200, and the net income RMB800, which means the overhead cost is still RMB800, not RMB700! Here it is very clear that overhead cost is not the difference between actual income and direct cost, but (expected) income and direct cost.

However, if one thinks the actual income lower than expected one not because of accidental bad luck but inaccurate information about the market, he should adjust his estimate about the situation in the next month. Suppose one expects the income of the next month to be RMB900, the electricity charge is still RMB200, and the net income or overhead cost RMB700.

Readers can deduce the contrary situation when the performance is better than expected by imitating the above analysis.

Thus it is clear that if one adjusts his expectation, overhead cost will be different from fixed cost, and can change along with the change in expectation. By contrast, fixed cost is, of course, fixed, and will never change, because it is essentially historical cost, and what has become history will never change again.

The analysis above is the most simplified, so next we will extend the analysis by relaxing the assumptions.

Suppose there are more than two production factors, they can be classified into those similar to rooms and those similar to electricity. The costs of the production factors similar to electricity are all direct costs, and the costs of the production factors similar to rooms are all overhead costs. When there is no output, instead of transferring only an idle production factor (such as room), the whole business (excluding production factors similar to electricity is transferred, and the income will be the rent of the whole business. Thus, this rent is the overhead cost of the whole business, which is shown in Table 13-1.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Shutdown|0|Income－DC|－OC|
|B：No Shutdown|Income－DC|0|OC|

As has been explained in the previous lecture, there will be rent if the options are observed roughly. Overhead cost is rent, because only two options are roughly observed: shutdown (to withdraw from the market) and no shutdown (to stay in the market and continue the business). Obviously, as long as there is overhead cost, even if the income is less than expectation, but at least can still cover the direct cost, producer will not choose to shut down. In other words, overhead cost can be regarded as rent from the second perspective which means the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. Here even if the income from the market has decreased to be less than expectation, producer still chooses not to shut down or stay in the market to continue the business, so the supply does not change. It is why the essence of overhead cost is rent.

To sum up, the definition, the calculation formula and the essence of overhead cost can be deduced from each other.
