# Section 5: Profit

As mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, it is inappropriate for MSE to use the term “profit” to refer to the difference between income and (opportunity) cost. After the explanation of the concept of rent in previous sections, readers should understand the concept of rent is far beyond the scope of that of profit. In essence, profit in MSE is a concept defined by a mathematical formula, which is not as rich in economic implication as rent.

More importantly, the term “profit” needs to be defined differently from rent in this book and profit in MSE. We define “profit” as the difference between actual income and opportunity cost.

As has stressed in the previous lecture of “the Concept of Cost”, cost in economics must refer to that in the future, which is completely different from the actual expenditure (historical cost or accounting cost) in the past. In other words, cost must be expected cost. Expectation is intention, not a fact, but it can be deduced by examining the objective facts that make the expectation come into being. It is logically similar that income in economics is expected income, not actual one. Before making a choice, one expects the future, which means he expects the income and cost in the future, and the difference between them is rent, and then he makes a choice according to the principle of rent maximization. When the choice has been made, the difference between actual income and expected cost (opportunity cost) is profit.

Based on the previous lecture and this lecture, there are three formulas: (1) rent＝expected income－expected cost (opportunity cost); (2) accounting profit＝actual income－actual cost (historical cost/accounting cost); (3) profit＝actual income－expected cost (opportunity cost). As mentioned before, all income is cost, and there is not such income as is not cost, so expected income＝expected cost (opportunity cost) as long as options are sub-divided into countless sub-options. Thus, the formula of profit can be rewritten as: profit＝actual income－expected income. In other words, profit is essentially unexpected income.

Once a choice is made, it is like the water poured out, which means the actual income, just like historical cost, will no longer affect people’s choice. Similarly, profit cannot affect people’s choice, because whether there is profit and how much it is cannot be expected. People choose according to expectation, so profit beyond expectation is meaningless.

For example, if one accidentally picks up a wallet when he walks on a road, it is his unexpected income or profit. If one accidentally loses his wallet instead, it is also his unexpected (negative) income or (negative) profit. Thus profit can be positive or negative.

There is profit because there is information cost which makes one’s expected income different from actual income: he does not know in advance that he can pick or lose wallet on the road. As long as the constraint of information cost remains unchanged, profit cannot affect people’s behavior. One will not walk on that road every day after accidentally picking a wallet and expects to pick a wallet again. Neither will he avoid walking on that road just because he has accidentally lost his wallet and expects to lose it again.
