# Section 4: The Concept of Rent from the Second Perspective

Seen from the second perspective, rent is the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. This definition sounds very difficult to understand, let’s give an example. Classical economists noticed an obvious feature of land that the supply of it seemed unchanged. There is so much land on earth, which will not change due to the change in rent of land (income from land). Therefore, rent seems to be a “surplus” of income, which means even if the rent of land falls to zero, there is still so much land available on earth. Some of classical economists such as Henry George advocated that government should impose all taxes on landlords, so that even if their income of rent dropped to 0, the supply of land would not be affected, thus neither would the whole economy be affected.

However, is it really the case? As mentioned in the previous section, if a landlord is not allowed to obtain rent of land based on the exploitation theory of Marx, he will take back the land from the agricultural production. In other words, if the rent of land is really reduced to 0, landlords will choose not to use the land, so that although there is much land on earth, the amount of land that is effectively supplied to the market is 0.

What if the rent significantly decreases but does not drop to 0? It is similar to the effect of price control which is strongly enforced, and effectively prohibits of all kinds of means such as contract fee from going around it. Suppose the price control stipulates the rent of a house cannot be more than RMB800 a month, the houses originally worth more than RMB800 would be withdrawn from the house renting market, and switched to the factory or shop leasing market or simply sold out. In other words, a piece of land or a house can be supplied not only to the market of a specific production, so the supply of it will decrease with the decrease of rent in that specific market.

What is more, a landlord can also reduce the quality of his house to a level compatible with the regulated price of RMB800 such as no provision of furniture and no maintenance of the house. The houses originally worth RMB1000 are still supplied to the house renting market under the rent control of RMB800, which seems that RMB200 of rent is a surplus. However, does the supply of landlords really not change? No! The supply of the houses with high quality which are so high-priced decreases completely to 0! Only the houses with low quality compatible with the regulated rent of RMB800 are supplied to the market.

Here is another example of rent decrease not caused by price control, because it is more universal and there is not additional effect of rent dissipation caused by price control. As we all know, there are many houses around a university for students to rent, and there is obvious seasonal fluctuation of rent. The beginning of each semester is the peak season for the houses, so the rent will rise to the highest at that time. And the end of each semester, especially the Spring Festival in winter vacation, is the off season for the houses, so the rent will drop to the lowest at this time. Suppose the rent in peak season is RMB1000, while that in off season is RMB800. The rent has changed, but the supply of the houses does not change. The difference of RMB200 seems to be a surplus. However, although the supply of the houses remains unchanged, do the landlords really not change at all? Of course not. The landlords in peak season will be more active in cleaning their houses, and may even spend money on renovating the houses, so as to increase the quality of the houses to the level that worth the rent of RMB1000. By contrast, in off season, landlords will be less active in maintaining their houses in the best condition to attract tenants. In other words, the quantity supplied remains unchanged, while the quality supplied has changed.

The thought that change in the income of land will not cause change in the supply of it, just because the options are observed roughly, so that only two options of “Use” and “Not use” are observed. It seems as if the supply of land will not change until the rent falls to 0. However, if the option of “Use” is further subdivided, there are in fact many sub-options included in it, such as used as “agricultural land”, “industrial land” and “residential land”. For example, if the income from agricultural land falls, some of the lands will be withdrawn from the market of agricultural land and turn to that of other uses of land. Of course, there are still some lands unchanged in the supply of agricultural land. However, there are also in fact many sub-options in the option of agricultural land, such as growing different crops, with or without fertilizer, and so on. The agricultural lands have actually changed to some extend along with the change in the income, but just have not changed beyond the scope of the “agricultural land”. Thus they seem to have not changed, and there seems to be part of income when the supply does not change with the income, which is precisely rent. In other words, it is again the amazing feature of rent that it seems sometimes large and sometimes small and sometimes zero depending on how the options are observed.

There is rent not because the behaviors such as supply have not changed, but the changing options are not observed. Remind the statement in section 2: All income is cost, only part of it is the cost of the options observed, and part of it is the cost of the options not observed. In order to distinguish the options observed and not observed, the former is directly called “cost” and the latter is called “rent”. Now it should be easier to understand this second perspective from which the definition of rent is the part of income when the supply does not change with the income. The part of income where the supply is observed to change with the income has classified as cost, while the part of income where the supply is not observed to change with the income is regarded as unchanged and classified as rent.

The rent of land can be generalized to that of all other production factors or assets. Take Elvis Presley as the example of labor. Elvis Presley was a truck driver before he became a popular singer, and earned just a few hundred dollars a month at that time. By contrast, he earned tens of millions of dollars every year as a singer. For the sake of simplicity, suppose he earned $1,000 a year when he was a driver, while he earned $10 million a year when he was a singer. As shown in Table 12-6, the rent of Elvis Presley as a singer was as high as $9.999 million, which meant he would not change from a singer to a driver until his income as a singer dropped from $10 million to $1,000, so he seemed to be unchanged in supply of singer.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Driver|0.001|10|-9.999|
|B：Singer|10|0.001|9.999|

However, it is only because the options of Elvis Presley are observed too roughly, and he is thought to have only two options: “Driver” and “Singer”. In fact, the option of “Singer” can be subdivided into numerous sub-options, such as choosing different record companies, choosing different songs, choosing to release albums or to hold concerts, choosing to sing more or less songs, even choosing to laugh more or less ... all are different sub-options. If all the sub-options are sorted by their incomes, the income of the sub-optimum must be infinitely close to that of the optimum, thus is the cost of the optimum, and the rent of the optimum is infinitely close to 0.

In fact, the case shown in Table 12-6 is not the roughest observation of Elvis Presley’s options. Both “Driver” and “Singer” are jobs, and are the same option if observed most roughly. There are only options of “Work” and “Not work” if observed most roughly, which is shown in Table 12-7 that Elvis Presley’s rent reached the maximum of $10 million when all his income was rent. Is it essentially the same as the options of “Use” and “Not use” for a piece of land? Thus, not only the supply of land does not change with income, but it is also the same for labor, actually for all production factors or assets. Classical economists thought that the feature of the rent of land is unique, but is actually universal.

||Income|Cost|Rent|
|----|----|----|----|
|A：Driver|0|10|-10|
|B：Singer|10|0|10|

After explaining the two perspectives for understanding the concept of rent, readers should find them the same in essence.

From the first perspective, rent is the income of production factor or the value of asset, which is the roughest observation of options, so all the income of production factor or asset is rent. From the second perspective, options are not sub-divided into countless sub-options, so some options have not been observed, and it seems that the supply does not change with the income, and part of income is regarded as rent.

Although the two perspectives are essentially the same, it is still necessary to distinguish from which perspective the concept of rent is used in a specific case. For example, the “rent” in “rent dissipation” refers to the concept from the first perspective, because it means the loss in the income of an asset when the price of it is regulated. And the concept of overhead cost to be introduced in the next lecture is essentially rent from the second perspective, because it means that income fluctuation in an industry does not necessarily cause producers to leave the market and reduce supply.
