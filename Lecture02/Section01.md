# Section1: Economics is a Science – Methodology of Science (1): Refutability[^1]


Economics is a science. Science is an activity of human intelligence. It starts from one or several postulates or axioms from which a set of theories and inferences are established as a system. Besides, all the conclusions of this theoretical system must be tested by fact.

This definition of “Science” can be divided into three stages also known as “Trilogy of Science”.

The first stage is postulates and axioms, which is the starting point of science. It does not need proof; neither needs to be true; it just needs to be accepted without any doubts. Sceptics doubt everything including those as a starting point. But what can be done without a starting point?

The second stage is a logical deduction. Mathematics as a tool assisting logical deduction may be useful for science. However, Math is not science itself, but a useful tool for the second stage of science.

The third stage is the fact test, which makes the distinction between science and math: there are only the previous two stages in math (Geometry is a typical instance). Without this third stage, math is not science. Since the first stage of science needs no proof and does not allow any doubts, it seems very arbitrary and even unreasonable. Then how can be it sure to be OK? That is why science needs the support of fact in the third stage.

It is the third stage that distinguishes science from math. Therefore, an essential feature of science is not provability, but refutability. That is, fact can refute it[^2].

There is a serious and rather common misunderstanding about science that should be clarified. The public usually presumes that science is equivalent to truth. This is a misconception as they are totally different. A statement with refutability is scientific; otherwise, it is non-scientific. The false is the refuted but the truth is not the unrefuted. Therefore, it is not contradictory to say science is false and non-science is true.

Let us consider this example of unscientific truth: a four-footed animal has four feet. It is impossible to find a fact to refute this statement, which means it is absolutely true. However, what is irrefutable is exactly unscientific. Think about it deeply; why is that the statement cannot be falsified or refuted? Because the former part of it just repeats the latter part. In other words, A is B, so B is A. Such un-scientific, but true statement is called tautology which means repetition. Human study science in order to discover new knowledge, but tautology does not add any new knowledge; instead, it only repeats what already established. That is why tautology is absolutely true but becomes unscientific.

Tautology is not the only case of irrefutable statements. There are also four kinds of unscientific statements: unreality, ambiguity, contradiction and unrestrained.

The statement of “God exists.” is unscientific; instead, it is associated more with religion. The question here is why so? This is because the concept of God is not a fact, and it cannot be tested by facts, which leads to irrefutability.

Seen from another point of view, the concept “God” is ambiguous, which also leads to irrefutability. Superstition, which is somewhat similar to religion, tries to avoid being refuted with ambiguity. 

Here is a story: Three students go to take an important public examination. They meet a fortune-teller on the road, so ask him to predict their examination results. The fortune-teller just raises a finger and says nothing. 

Possible outcomes: If one of them passes the examination, that one-finger means one succeeds. If two of them pass, it means one of them fails. If all of them pass or do not pass, it means they as a group succeed or fail[^3]. Whatever the result will be, the fortune-teller can redefine the ambiguous meaning of the one-finger to make sure he is always right. However, it is unscientific precisely because it is irrefutable.

The statement of “There is a black point on an all-white wall.” is also unscientific. With this contradiction, the conclusion of “The wall is a god” will be deducted. Is it only an omnipotent god who can be both black and white?

In a math class at middle schools, they teach that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, only a few know that it is also the way of testing science.

 If “A ⇒ B” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” instead of “not (A) ⇒ not (B)”should be used. 

By analogy if “A ⇒ B and C” is tested, then “not (B) ⇒ not (A)” and “not (C) ⇒ not (A)” should be used. If “A ⇒ B, C, D…” is tested, because there are limitless propositions deduced from A, the test about A are endless, and become irrefutable. It is not easy to find a simple case to illustrate this situation of unrestrained, which will be pointed out when it occurs.

“Scientific faults” are refutable statements and have been refuted by facts. For example; there are two conflicting theories of Heliocentric and Geocentric on the relationship between sun and earth.

Which of them is true? How to test them? Copernicus argued that if Heliocentric were true, then Venus would be waxing and waning like the moon, which is "A ⇒ B" where A is Heliocentric, and B is the Venus' phase. So the test condition for this statement is that if the Venus were not waxing and waning, Heliocentric would be false, which is "not (A) ⇒ not (B)". Heliocentric can present a refutable condition, so it is scientific. On the other hand, Geocentric can also present its refutable condition: if the Venus were waxing and waning, Geocentric would be false, so it is scientific too. Afterwards, Galileo observed with a telescope, found that the Venus does be waxing and waning, which refuted Geocentric and supported Heliocentric. Then Geocentric is scientifically false because it has been reputed though it is reputable. By contrast, Heliocentric is not only refutable but also true, because the observation of Galileo does not refute it. "Reputability" is the characteristic of science, while "Refuted" is the end of false theories, which should not be confused with each other.

Thus human observes the reality, exact the laws out of facts, then make up science theories which can be used to explain what has happened and predict what will happen. If the explanations and predictions have not been refuted by facts, then theories can be accepted as true. But if they are refuted, the theories need to be revised, or even abandoned entirely.

The example of Heliocentric illustrates that the theories accepted as true are not true. More accurately speaking, they are just not refuted for now, which does not mean that they will never be refuted in the future, because they are always refutable in science. In fact, with the development of Astronomy, Heliocentric theory has been revised from the idea that all planets, including the Earth, move around the Sun from the centric orbits to the oval orbits. Now the heliocentric theory has been abandoned and replaced by the theory of cosmic expansion because the sun is no longer believed as the center of the Universe.

Logics also deny that science or refutable theories can be absolutely true. For example, even human has seen thousands of white swans and find no one is black; still, they cannot conclude that there are no black ones in the world. The statement “all swans are white” can be accepted as true, but just for now.
Of course, only scientifically true theories are desirable, because they can increase human’s knowledge and guide the practice. As mentioned above, it is the same for explaining what has happened and predicting what will happen. In practice, human firstly tries to explain what has happened to construct theories, then with which predict what will happen by observing if the predictions come true, human test the theories again and again.

It seems rather abstract, so let us take examples to illustrate the above interpretation. In Physics, Newton’s laws explain or deduct the phenomenon of an apple falling on the ground. They are accepted as true because we never see an apple flying to the sky. Airplanes that can fly to the sky are invented, which does not violate but apply Newton’s laws. As long as the conditions required by Newton’s laws are satisfied, airplanes never fall from the sky, which proves the laws are true. 

So, why is Economics scientific?

Economics is a set of systematic theories deduced from a postulate which is “human are all self-interested”, and an axiom which is the Law of Demand. Economics can be used to explain some phenomena that cannot be explained by Physics. For example, there is a $100 bill in a public place. Physics can explain why it is gone with the wind. However, it cannot explain why the bill is still gone without wind which only can be explained by economics.

The Theory of Supply and Demand (TSD) introduced in later lectures argues that the price will rise if the demand exceeds the supply, while the price will fall if the supply exceeds the demand. As long as the conditions required by the TSD are satisfied, it has never been refuted. If the government imposes price control, forbidding sellers to increase prices when the demand exceeds supply, it seems that the price does not rise, but it does in the other form, such as the time spent on queuing and the red pockets paid as bribe. The logic is similar to the fact of airplanes flying to the sky does not violate Newton’s laws. So, it just proves that the TSD is true again.

Some scholars call those subjects without refutability, such as Logics and Mathematics, as "Formal Science", while those with refutability as "Empirical Science". That concept of science is a broad-sense one. This book use “Science” in narrow-sense which is refutable, i.e. "Empirical Science".
