# Section 10: The Monetary Policy Tools of Central Bank

In economics textbooks (including the textbooks such as “Money and Banking”), three major monetary policy tools of central bank are listed: the adjustment of the legal DRR, the adjustment of the rediscount rate, and the Open Market Operation.

(1) The adjustment of the legal DRR

The adjustment of the legal DRR refers to adjusting R, thus changing the money multiplier. However, in all economics textbooks, it will be supplemented quickly that this monetary policy tool is a blockbuster that is rarely used. In fact, the central banks initially implemented this legal DRR not as a monetary policy tool, but as a means of controlling the risks of commercial banks. Reserve deposits are those that banks cannot lend out, so there is an opportunity cost for banks and they are reluctant to keep too many reserve deposits. If there are not enough reserve deposits, there will be a risk that depositors cannot withdraw their. In addition to implementing monetary policies, the functions of a central bank also include supervision of commercial banks, so it implemented a mandatory legal DRR to prevent the banks from keeping too few reserve deposits.

Later, when economists studied monetary theory, they found that the DRR is an important factor that directly determines the money multiplier, so the adjustment of the legal DRR can be a monetary policy tool in theory. In fact, central banks rarely use this tool, but the central bank of China has frequently used it after 2008, which seriously harmed Chinese economy. The purpose of monetary policy is to stabilize the value of money and provide a stable environment for economic growth. Even if DRR is only slightly adjusted, it will greatly change the money supply through the amplification effect of the money multiplier, which causes economic fluctuation.

What is more, the adjustment of legal DRR also seriously interferes with the business decisions of commercial banks. DRR should be determined by the proportion of deposits withdrawn from the banks every day, so the unnecessarily high legal DRR will cause a large amount of deposits to be idle and the banks to be unable to make normal profits, which will reduces the efficiency and is actually an increase in transaction cost.

(2) The adjustment of the rediscount rate

The term of “discount rate” has been introduced in Lecture 18, but there it is used to convert the future value into present value, while here it refers to the interest rate charged by a bank when a firm sells commercial paper to it.

A firm can provide short-term financing to a buyer in the form of “accounts receivable” in transactions, which means a buyer can receive the goods without paying immediately until three months, six months or other different periods later. In essence, the firm has lent a sum of money equivalent to the payment of the goods to the buyer, and the loan period is three months, six months, etc. The buyer can also issue a commercial bill to the firm, indicating the amount and the date of the payment on it, and then the firm’s accounting entry is not “accounts receivable”, but “bills receivable”. The firm can choose to hold the bill until the maturity date to request the buyer to honor the bill, or sell the bill to a bank before the maturity date, which means it has transferred the bill to the bank, and the bank will request the buyer to honor the bill on the maturity date.

Since the bank has bought this commercial paper, it needs to pay the firm. In theory, the payment should be based on the face value (the payment of the goods), but the bank needs to make money on this operation, so it will make a discount on the face value before making payment. The difference between the money actually paid by the bank to the firm and the face value of the bill is actually interest, because the bank allows the firm to get the payment before the maturity date, which is equivalent to lending the money to it, and it is the buyer who will repay the bank on the maturity date. The interest rate in this case is also called “discount rate” that is not essentially different from the term introduced in Lecture 18 because it does be the discount rate of future value (the payment on the maturity date).

Since the discount rate is the interest rate at which a firm borrows money from a bank, the rediscount rate is the interest rate at which a bank borrows money from the central bank. If a firm is short of money, it borrows from a bank. What if a bank is short of money? As mentioned in Lecture 18, there is an interbank market, in which a bank can borrow money from other banks. It can also borrow money from the central bank, because the central bank can print money and it is sure to have money. In fact, the central bank is called the “lender of last resort” of the whole economy, because it is responsible to provide the monetary base for an economy.

The term “rediscount” refers to that a bank sells bills to the central bank. It cannot sell commercial bills, because the central bank is a government agency rather than a commercial institution and cannot participate in the operation of firms. The bills sold by a bank are central bank bills or treasury bonds that are securities issued by the central bank or the Ministry of Finance. Since the discount rate is the interest rate at which a bank lends money to firms, the rediscount rate is, of course, the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to banks.

If the central bank raises the rediscount rate, it means the interest rate of loans paid by banks to the central bank rises, so they will also raise the interest rate of loans to firms. Rising interest rate will inhibit firms from borrowing money, thus reducing investment and production, at last affecting economic growth, so it is a tight monetary policy. On the contrary, if the central cuts the rediscount rate, the market interest rate will also decline, which will encourage firms to borrow money, thus increasing investment and expanding production, at last stimulating economic growth, so it is an expansionary monetary policy.

However, the adjustment of rediscount rate is also rarely used in western countries now, because the central bank is in a passive position and has to wait for commercial banks to borrow money. Especially as the interbank market is booming, commercial banks often borrow money from peers unless it is tight money in the whole banking system and the interest rate in the interbank market is also very high, or there is problem for the bank, so the credit risk of default has increased greatly, and no one is willing to lend money to it in the interbank market.

(3) Open market operation.

It refers to the operation of the central bank to release or recover money by buying and selling securities (mainly foreign exchange, treasury bonds, central bank bills, etc.) in the open market (including foreign exchange market, monetary market, etc.). If the central bank wants to implement an expansionary monetary policy which means releasing money into the economy, it will buy securities in the open market, and release money by paying money. On the contrary, if the central bank wants to implement a tight monetary policy which means recovering money from the economy, it will sell securities in the open market, and recover money by collecting money.

Compared with the above two monetary policy tools, open market operation has the advantages of activeness, flexibility and timeliness. The central bank can fully control the scale of operation and has considerable activeness. Open market operation is flexible, because the central bank can adjust the direction of monetary policy and the money supply at will. The timeliness is also very good, because the central bank can implement the monetary policy immediately and continuously as long as the market is open.

The monetary policies of various nations are mainly implemented through open market operation. For example, 90% of the money release or recovery of the Fed is carried out through open market operation.
