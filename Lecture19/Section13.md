# Section 13: From the Monetary Policy Regulating Economy to the Monetary System Stabilizing Money Value

According to the statement that internal inflation is the same as external currency depreciation, why shouldn’t Zhu’s system of stabilizing the exchange rate with monetary policy be used to control inflation? In fact, it is precisely the argument of monetary school that monetary policy should not be used to stimulate economic growth, but only to control inflation or keep the value of money, which means monetary policy has become monetary system.

However, is it not what most developed countries do now? The central bank keeps an eye on CPI to adjust monetary policy, which means it will adopt tight money policy when there is high inflation rate, and easy monetary policy when low inflation rate. What is special about the monetary system of Zhu? Zhu’s system will be introduced in detail.

Zhu’s system of stabilizing the exchange rate with monetary policy is right in general direction, but it is necessary to be improved on an important detail. The general direction refers to pegging a clearly visible target (anchor) by increasing or decreasing the money supply to stabilize the value of money. The central bank as the issuer of money is completely independent in increasing or decreasing the money supply, and does not need to be subject to anything uncontrollable by it (such as the reserves of US dollar). Therefore, this “pegging” is feasible.

But an important detail is what the target is. As mentioned in Section 11, the intermediate target must be “measurable, controllable and correlative”. With the open market operation as the monetary policy tool, there is no problem for the requirement of controllability, so there are the requirements of measurability and correlation left. For measurability, the target must be clearly visible. If it were not, how to peg to it? It is like when one is shooting, he needs to aim at the target, but if the target is not clearly visible, how can he judge whether he has aimed and hit it? Obviously, Zhu chose the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB that is a clearly visible target because there is foreign exchange market to make all can see the exchange rate every minute and even every second, and it is accurate to four digits after decimal point.

Besides, the target must reliably represent the value of money for the requirement of correlation, because the value of money derives from that of goods it exchanges for. For a good target, when money has pegged to it, the value of money has also pegged to the value of goods. Zhu’s system of pegging RMB to US dollar cannot meet this requirement. The US dollar is only another currency, not goods. Unless the value of US dollar is stable, which means the exchange rate between the US dollar and goods is stable, and a direct peg to the US dollar is equivalent to an indirect peg to goods, Zhu’s system can really stabilize the value of RMB instead of just the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB.

It was lucky that during Zhu was the president of PBC and then the Prime Minister of China, the value of US dollar had been rather stable. As known to all, Clinton was the president of the US from 1993 to 2000, and during his term, the economy of US had experienced a long period of high growth and low inflation that was called “new economy”. Besides, during much the same period (1991-2005), Greenspan was the chairman of the Fed, and had been adopting the “strong dollar” policy of controlling inflation domestically and keeping the US dollar strong in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the value of the US dollar value during this period had been stable and strong, which made it a very good target for pegging.

However, good time did not last long. Since 2003, as the economy worsened in the US, while that in China continued to grow, the exchange rate between these two currencies needed to represent the competitiveness of countries behind, so the U.S. dollar was under pressure to depreciate against RMB. However, as RMB was pegged to the US dollar by Zhu’s system, the US dollar could not depreciate against the RMB to reflect the fact that the economic strength of the US had declined relative to that of China. From then on, the US had been criticizing China to manipulate the exchange rate, requiring it to increase the value of RMB. The underlying reason for it is precisely that the US dollar has no longer been stable, and not a good target for RMB to peg.

In fact, it cannot be a long-term solution to peg to another country’s currency, unless it also pegs to a good target, which means pegging to it is equivalent to pegging to the good target. After all, the value of money derives from that of goods, not from that of another country’s currency. Thus, what is a good target?

From ancient times until the US dollar has become an international currency after the World War II, the general monetary system was gold standard. If it is the true gold standard system, gold is precisely what money is pegged to. For example, if it is stipulated that the central bank can only issue RMB100 when there is 1 once of good in the warehouse, the price of gold (the exchange rate between gold and money) will be stabilize at the RMB100/ounce. It can be regarded that RMB has pegged to gold.

As long as the central bank issues money strictly in accordance with the above ratio, no speculators can change the price of gold, and neither can they change the value of RMB. Suppose there are 1 million ounces of gold in the warehouse, the central bank will issue 100 million RMB. There is only so much RMB in the market, and the speculators can only get up to 100 million RMB to exchange for gold. When they exchange all the 1 million ounces of gold from the central bank, which means the central bank has no more reserves of gold, but neither will there be any RMB in the market, so the speculators will not be able to sell out more RMB in the market to change the exchange rate.

In the financial crisis of 1997, the Southeast Asian countries ran out of foreign exchange reserves under the attack of speculators and had to surrender to depreciate their currencies, because they did not strictly issue money according to the exchange rate between their currencies and the US dollar, or else it was impossible that there were not enough reserves of US dollar. In other words, Southeast Asian countries had adopted a “pseudo dollar standard”.

By contrast, besides the RMB of China had been successfully defended, neither had Hong Kong’s dollar depreciated, not because China declared that if Hong Kong’s foreign exchange reserves were insufficient, China would lend the foreign exchange reserves to support Hong Kong, but because Hong Kong’s monetary system was “Linked Exchange Rate System”. It refers to that Hong Kong Monetary Authority issues Hong Kong dollar at a ratio of 1:7.8 (US dollar to Hong Kong dollar) strictly based on the reserves of US dollar. In other words, Hong Kong has adopted a “real dollar standard”, which is logically similar to the real gold standard, except that the standard currency is US dollar instead of gold, so Hong Kong dollar is pegged to US dollar.

However, although both RMB and Hong Kong dollar are pegged to US dollar, Zhu’s system is different from Hong Kong’s monetary system, because PBC does not issue RMB based on the reserves of US dollar. There must be reserves of US dollar in Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate system, but it is not necessary for Zhu’s system. Take the gold standard as an example, and suppose the change rate between gold and RMB is 1:100. If it were Hong Kong’s system, the central bank could only issue RMB100 when it holds 1 ounce of gold. However, for Zhu’s system, the central bank does not need to hold any gold, but keeps an eye on the price of gold in the market. If it rises to be higher than RMB100/ounce, the central bank should adopt tight money policy to decrease the quantity of RMB in the market relative to gold, thus causing the price of gold to fall. If the price of gold falls to less than RMB100/ounce, the central bank should adopt expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of RMB in the market relative to gold, thus causing the price of gold to rise.

There are several advantages for Zhu’s system compared with Hong Kong’s system.

(1) The most direct advantage is that the central bank does not need to hold reserves (gold, US dollar, or anything as the target of money).

(2) The money supply in an economy is actually far more than the paper money (monetary base) issued by the central bank, and most of money is the deposit money created by commercial banks. Although the quantity of deposit money is related to that of monetary base, it is not directly controlled by the central bank. Therefore, it is possible that the central bank wants to adjust the money supply by changing the quantity of monetary base, but that of deposit money does not change as expected, so neither does the money supply change as expected, which make the price level still unstable. In addition, for the international currency such as US dollar that can “leak” out of the country, it is even more difficult for the central bank to effectively control the money supply.

In other words, if the central bank issues monetary base based on the reserves, because the intermediate link from monetary base to deposit money is extremely complicated, and for the international currency that can “leak” out of the country, it is very difficult to stabilize the price level by controlling the effective money supply. Therefore, it is better not to calculate what the appropriate money supply is, but to directly stabilize the price level. As the above example of gold standard, with Zhu’s system, the price of gold is directly stabilized by monetary policy instead of issuing money based on the reserves. The essence of Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate system is to peg the quantity of money to that of reserves, while the essence of Zhu’s system is to peg the value of money to the price of target.

(3) The value of money derives from the goods it exchanges for, and what money exchanges for is more than gold. Gold, as a good rather than a currency, is useless, so pegging to gold is actually similar to pegging to another currency such as US dollar. Just the US dollar is a kind of paper money that can be overprinted, while gold is a precious metal that cannot be as much as one’s will, so it is not easy to create inflation under gold standard. It is precisely why gold had done well as an international currency for thousands of years, while the US dollar has been overprinted in only half a century. As money, gold is inherently stable, while all paper money is easily overprinted to create inflation.

Gold as money is still not a good, and the value of money does not derives from it but goods. There are so many goods in the world, and some of them are perishable, how can they are directly used as the reserves. What is more, when multiple goods are used as the targets of pegging money, what should be the exchange rate between money and the multiple goods? Obviously, Hong Kong’s system is simply not feasible if multiple goods are directly used as the targets, but Zhu’s system is.
