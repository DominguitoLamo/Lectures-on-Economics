# Section 6: The History of Paper Money

Since the value of money derives from that of goods, in order to stabilize the value (purchasing power) of money, it is necessary to make the quantity of money change along with that of the quantity of goods in real economy.

In reality, there are two major difficulties in implementing this principle. Firstly, the issuer does not want to implement this principle at all, but only print money at will. Secondly, it is difficult to know clearly what the effective quantity of money in an economy is, which is the problem of measuring the money supply.

Let us discuss the first difficulty, and start with introducing the history of paper money and the evolution of the international monetary system.

As mentioned in the introduction about the history of money in previous section, human had used salt and shells as money, but later they all turned to precious metals such as gold  that is most suitable for money. In order to facilitate small transactions, coins of base metals had been issued. Coins are subsidiary, while gold (or silver) is the standard currency, because the value of coins is determined by the price ratio of the base metals and precious metals contained in them. In other words, the monetary system of ancient societies was gold standard (that in China was silver standard). Within a nation, coins can be used in transaction, but transactions between different nations (international trade) are settled in gold. The ratio between coins in different nations is fixed, which is called fixed exchange rate system. For example, if 10 pounds in Britain is equivalent to 1 ounce of gold, while RMB20 in China is equivalent to 1 ounce of gold, 1 pound in Britain is equivalent to RMB2 in China, and this exchange rate between Britain and China is fixed.

However, whether it is the standard currency of precious metals or the auxiliary coins of base metals, they are heavy and inconvenient to carry and transport. With the development of long-distance trade, this inconvenience becomes very troublesome. As early as the Song Dynasty, “Jiaozi” that is actually a receipt appeared in China. A businessman deposited his gold in a money house (the predecessor of bank), and the money house would give him a receipt stating when and how much gold was deposited by whom. The businessman took the receipt to another city, showed it to the branch of the same money house in that city, and withdrew the amount of gold recorded on the receipt. Obviously, the money house was responsible for keeping the businessmen’s gold, and the businessman enjoyed the service of the withdrawal of deposits from different places provided by bank today. The businessman with Jiaozi can avoid the trouble of carrying and transporting heavy gold and reduce the risk of being robbed of gold during his trip.

With the development of trade, some businessmen, when they wanted to pay for their goods, simply transferred their Jiaozis to the sellers who took them to the bank to withdraw gold. Since the name of the buyer instead of the seller was written on the receipt, the buyer needed to declare on the back of the Jiaozi, “I would like to transfer the withdrawal right of the Jiaozi to so and so.” It is called “endorsement”. Until today, commercial bills can be transferred by such endorsement. The seller took the receipt with endorsement to the money house, and the money house would give him the gold deposited by the buyer according to the amount written on the Jiaozi.

Afterward, the Jiaozi issued by the creditable money houses was widely accepted, and the sellers were no longer in a hurry to withdraw the gold because they believed that the creditable money houses did have so much gold in their warehouses. Instead, they held the Jiaozis in their hands, and when they wanted to buy some goods, they could transfer them to the sellers by “re-endorsement”, thus reducing the trouble of drawing heavy gold for payment.

However, with such continuous endorsements, the space behind the Jiaozi was limited and could not contain so many endorsements soon. At last, the credible money houses issued formatted Jiaozis with the same face value. For example, each Jiaozi had the face value of 1 liang (a Chinese unit of weight) of gold, so the businessman who deposits 10 liang of gold would be given 10 such Jiaozis that are bearer notes and did not need endorsements when transferring. The money houses would pay the gold according to the face value to anyone who presented the Jiaozis. Thus, such Jiaozis had already become paper money.

Strictly speaking, this kind of paper money was actually bank note issued by private money houses or banks. In English, the words such as “note” and “bill” can refer to money, which implies that the original paper money was bank note.

These bank notes were backed by sufficient gold reserves, not credit money or Fiat Money. Because a bank gave the paper money to a businessman according to how much gold he had deposited in the bank, there were gold reserves equivalent to the face value of each paper money in the bank’s warehouse. This kind of paper money is called “paper money with full reserves”. The bank notes with sufficient reserves are actually tokens (not the same as coins made of base metal), which means they are only the representatives of the standard currency such as gold.

School dining halls usually required students to exchange RMB for meal tickets before. The exchange rate is 1:1, which means 1RMB exchanged for 1 meal ticket. This meal ticket was precisely a token, which was the representative of RMB to circulate only in the dining hall. It was logically the same that bank notes could only circulate within a nation. Another example is the round and plastic tokens used in game rooms.

Token is characterized in that it is strictly issued in accordance with the currency it represents. This token-based paper money system can be called the “true standard system”. If gold is the standard currency, it is the “true gold standard system”, which is not much different from the “gold standard system” where gold as money directly circulates in the economy. In the true gold standard system, gold is still the standard currency, and paper money just represents it to circulate. The money supply is determined by the quantity of gold in circulation and in inventory, but the circulation of paper currency greatly reduces the transaction cost. Since bank notes are issued strictly according to the gold received, it is impossible to be overprinting and currency crisis in true gold standard system. As long as the quantity of gold does not suddenly increase sharply, which is far beyond the increase in the quantity of goods in real economy, it is also impossible to be serious inflation.

However, the problem is that once paper money is accepted and circulated in the economy, the bank will be tempted issue paper money out of line with the gold reserves, thus actually violating the true gold standard and becoming the pseudo gold standard. The cost of printing a piece of paper money with a face value of RMB100 may only be 0.01RMB, while those who want to get it from the bank must pay for the goods worth RMB100. If a bank quietly issues a piece of paper money with a face value of RMB100, the profit is RMB99.99! This extremely high profit is called “seigniorage”.

Under the temptation of such high profit, it is no wonder that a bank will tend to print paper money out of line with the gold reserves. The consequence, of course, is inflation. At the very beginning, it is difficult to find that the bank does so, but eventually people will find something is wrong and begin to doubt why the bank issues so many notes that are obviously more than the gold reserves. Once they do not believe the bank can exchange all notes it issues for gold, people will run on the bank. The bank issues more paper money than the gold reserves, and certainly does not have so much gold to meet the need of cashing, so can only shut down and absconded with the money. It is financial fraud from the micro perspective, and a financial crisis from the macro perspective.

In Marx’s time, many countries did not have central banks, and neither did they have monetary policies. However, there had been economic crises so frequently (although far less serious than the Great Depression of 1929) that Marx doubted there was inherent defect of capitalism (market economy). In fact, the problem did not lie in capitalism, but in the barbaric and chaotic issuance of paper money. As has been clearly analyzed in previous section, in a world with money, instability in the value of money will lead to inflation or deflation, which will mislead economic entities to make wrong decisions and eventually result in economic fluctuations (business cycles). In essence, it is the increase in transaction cost of monetary system. In modern economy, inflation is mainly caused by the abuse of monetary policy of government (central bank), while in Marx’s time, inflation is mainly caused by the lack of management on the issuance of paper money because any private bank could issue paper money at will.

The Austrian school in economics advocates completely free market and opposes any form of government regulations, which is equivalent to “anarchism” in political philosophy. However, as has pointed out in Lecture 5, market system can reduce some transaction costs, but it will also bring another transaction costs. If the transaction costs reduced the market are less than those it increases under certain constraints, self-interested human will not choose market. If market can always reduce transaction costs more than those it increases, there will be no governments, firms, and other organizations, nor will be morality and a lot of non-price criteria voluntarily chosen by human in the world.

Monetary system is a typical example. If the right to issue paper money is delineated to any private banks, tempted by such high profit of seigniorage, there will always be banks that cannot help issuing more notes than the gold reserves. Some may argue that big banks will value their credit and will not do so. However, the fact is that there have always been financial frauds. More importantly, financial fraud is just a non-systematic risk, which will only harm those who are deceived, while excessive issuance of bank notes will cause systemic risks such as inflation, which will harm all who are not deceived.

Moreover, money is special in that as long as one bank overprints notes, the whole economy will suffer inflation even if the other banks do not. In a modern society that has not been gold standard, it is difficult to judge if the quantity of notes printed by a bank is too much or too few. It is the total quantity notes printed by the whole banking system that can be judged to be too much or too few. Therefore, if any private banks can print paper money, it is not clear which bank or banks should be responsible for inflation. However, if the right of issuance is concentrated in one bank (central bank), it is clear that this bank is responsible for inflation. In other words, it is the best institutional arrangement for knowing the total quantity of money and who should be responsible with the least information cost.

Of course, government or central bank is also possible to be tempted by seigniorage to issue excessive paper money. It is precisely why inflation has become a common phenomenon in modern economy. As mentioned in previous section, even in the ancient times when it was very inconvenient to create inflation, there were emperors who had issued worthless base metal coins to make up for the fiscal deficit and eventually led to the collapse of the regimes. However, the transaction cost of monitoring tens of thousands of private banks not to issue excessive notes is undoubtedly higher than that of a central bank. There is no absolutely safe and error-free institution in the world, and human can only choose the one with the least transaction cost as far as possible. Obviously, it is the system that is most likely to stabilize the value of money that the central bank as the monetary authority to monopolize the issuance of notes. From the transition from the system that any private banks can issue paper money, which caused continuous economic crises to the system that central banks were set up by almost all the nations to monopolize the issuance right of money, it is sufficient to prove that the transaction cost of controlling the issuance by the market is relatively high, and no wonder human have chosen the current monetary system.
