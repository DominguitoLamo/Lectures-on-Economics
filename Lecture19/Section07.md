# Section 7: The Truth of Bretton Woods System

In order to better overcome the difficulty of the issuer who is tempted by the high profits of seigniorage to overprint notes, the right to issue money is concentrated from numerous private banks to a central bank. However, private banks will overprint paper money, and so will a central bank. If a central bank issues notes strictly according to the gold reserves in the treasury, it is the true gold standard. Generally, there will be no inflation (unless there is a sudden great increase in the quantity of gold) and neither will be there economic crisis.

Since central banks in various nations have monopolized the power to issue notes, the super-inflation caused by excessive printing is not unique, and it has become common to print a little more to create small inflation. The reason to the former behavior similar to suicide is precisely the same as that of the trilogy of the collapse of the ancient Chinese dynasties. When a fiscal crisis is imminent, the central bank can only overprint money even it knows it is like drinking poison to quench thirst.

A typical example is the super-inflation in Germany after World War I and before World War II. After Germany’s defeat, it was forced to pay huge war reparations to the victorious nations, which caused the Germany to fall into an extremely difficult fiscal situation. Foreign reparations must be paid in hard currency such as gold, but domestic fiscal expenditures can be paid by overprinting money. As a result, the same horrible phenomena as “gold yuan” also occurred in Germany, and the soaring prices had wiped out a large number of people’s savings being overnight. In China, the super-inflation caused by “gold yuan” note led to the collapse of the regime of KMT party, while in Germany, it led to the rise and coming into power of Hitler and his Nazism.

On July 1, 1944, the Monetary and Financial Conference of United Nations that was later commonly known as the “Bretton Woods Conference” was held in Bretton Woods, United States. Although the Second World War was not completely over at that time, the Allies were sure that they would win the war. Therefore, their focus had shifted from the war to how to rebuild the new international order after the war. One of the important components of the new order was precisely the international monetary system.

All participants agreed that governments should not overprint money to fight against the fiscal crisis, and the international monetary system must return to the gold standard. However, most nations were faced with the problem that as two world wars broke out one after the other, the gold reserves originally held by rich European nations have almost all flowed into the United States. The US was not destroyed by the wars and had been continuously producing war materials for the other belligerent nations, so it had earned a large amount of gold as the international currency for settlement through international trade. As a result, most nations did not have enough gold reserves to issue money. The US proposed a compromise solution of the “Bretton Woods System” which meant the US that held a large amount of gold reserves issued US dollars that were directly linked to gold (at the ratio of 1 ounce of gold to 35 US dollars), and the currencies of other nations were linked to the US dollars, thus indirectly linked to gold. Under this international monetary system, the exchange rates between countries were still fixed, as in the gold standard.

However, there is some dirty trick in this Bretton Woods system! If most nations could not return to the gold standard because they did not have enough gold reserves, neither did they have enough US dollars at that time. It is precisely why the US implemented the European Renaissance Plan (commonly known as the “Marshall Plan” named by Marshall who was the marshal of US army in World War II and became the Secretary of State after it). The essence of Marshall Plan was to give US dollars to European nations for free, but in the name of helping Europe to rebuild from the ruins of war. Objectively if the US had not given large amounts of dollars to European nations through the Marshall Plan, the Bretton Woods System would not work.

The question is: why does the US not directly give gold for free? If the US directly gave gold to European nations, they would have enough gold reserves to issue currencies and return to the gold standard. The reason is obvious: the US dollar can be printed at negligible cost, and of course it can be given for free. What is more, European nations would pay back the US dollars to buy goods and services from US firms for reconstruction. However, it is only a superficial reason. The US could also lend gold to European nations at low interest rates or even free of interest, and they could still pay the gold to buy goods and services from US firms in international trade, and then pay back the principal of gold gradually. Why not?

If the US truly wants to help European nations to rebuild their economies and the gold standard, the Bretton Woods system is actually unnecessary. What was the motivation of the US? Economics cannot speculate on such unobservable psychological activities. However, the objective effect shows that the US dollar have successfully become an international currency with the aid of the Bretton Woods system, taking the place of gold as an international currency for thousands of years. Although before the First Industrial Revolution and the World War II, Britain’s economic strength had reached a peak and surpassed the rest nations of the world, and the British pound had accordingly become an international currency, it could not be a match for gold, let alone taking the place of gold. It is not natural that the US dollar has reached such important position as today.

At the end of World War II, there were little gold reserves for all nations. Now there are still little gold reserves for all nations, but they are holding a large amount of US dollars as foreign reserves. It is precisely why even if they are dissatisfied with the poor performance of the US dollar as an international currency, they could not get rid of it and return to the gold standard. In fact, the Bretton Woods system lasted only short time. Less than 30 years later, in 1971, the U.S. President Nixon’s refusal to exchange US dollars for gold was the symbol of its collapse. However, the U.S. dollar as an international currency has remained unchanged.

Gold had been used as an international currency for thousands of years and doing a good job. It was the fault of governments of various nations that overprinted money and abandoned the true gold standard before World War II, not the fault of gold that it did not do a good job as an international currency. By contrast, the US dollar has been used as an international currency for only 60 years, but there has been an international currency crisis almost once in a decade, which shows that it has done an extremely poor job.

The reason is very simple. Firstly, the US dollar is paper money, so it is easily overprinted, and when slightly there will be inflation, and when seriously there will be economic crisis. Secondly, the US dollar is the national currency of the US, but it serves as the international currency of the world. As the central bank of the US, the Fed will, of course, preferentially consider the interest of the US. It is impossible to require it to implement a monetary policy that is good for the whole world at the expense of the US. For example, during the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008, the Fed continuously adopted the monetary policy of “Quantitative Easing” (QE) in order to stimulate the US economy. As a result, it had not caused inflation in the US, but caused global inflation in many other nations.

Although the Bretton Woods System claimed to be true gold standard, actually it had quickly turned into a pseudo one due to the massive issuance of US dollars as well as the “Triffin Dilemma”. At the very beginning, the US dollars were rather scarce, so there was a “dollar shortage” in various nations. Then the Fed printed a large amount of money, and it quickly turned into a “dollar glut” because the US dollars issued had been far more than 35 times of the gold reserves.

Just as the private banks overprinted notes out of line with the gold reserves in their warehouses at the very beginning, people would not find out because the disconnection was not serious. However, the disconnection would be getting worse and worse, so sooner or later people would find that the gold reserves held by the Fed could not support such a large amount of US dollars issued. Once they do not believe in the Fed any more, people would exchange US dollars for gold, resulting in a sharp drop in the gold reserves of Fed. Within the half month of March 1968, the gold reserves of the Fed flowed out of more than 1.4 billion US dollars. On March 14, in the gold market of London, the volumes reached a record of 350-400 tons. At last, in 1971, after the dollar crisis had repeatedly broken out 7 times, the Fed refused to exchange gold for US dollars, which was simply default! The Bretton Woods System actually collapsed.

There seemed to be a debt crisis of the US in 2011, and there was rumor that US bonds might lose the AAA rating. Some US officials placated the market and said that the US government had never defaulted on the debts. Did he forget, or did he not realize that 40 years ago the Fed refused to exchange gold for US dollars, which was precisely the biggest debt default in history! When foreigners accepted US dollars, they actually had established a contract that the US government promised them that the US dollar was a voucher of debts for the products or services they provided, and they could always get the money back at a rate of 1 ounce of gold to 35 US dollars from the Fed. However, suddenly the US government refused to honor this promise.

After the collapse of the Bretton Woods System, the currencies of various nations have completely lost the stability of the gold standard. Any government can print as much paper money as they like, and are only constrained by the conscience and discipline. As a result, domestically inflation has become a common phenomenon, while internationally the exchange system has changed from a fixed one to a floating one. The exchange rate risk has increased greatly, which undoubtedly affects the development of international trade.

After World War II, the developed countries, under Keynes’s “instigation”, justifiably used monetary policies to increase money supply (in fact, create inflation) to stimulate economic growth. Due to money illusion, the real economy can indeed grow temporarily when people do not realize there is inflation. However, sooner or later, people will know the truth. Even if government continues to create inflation, the economy still returns to the previous sluggish state, but now with inflation. In the 1970s, western countries that had been using Keynes’s prescription for more than 20 years after the war, began to taste the bitter effects of it and had to face the dilemma of “stagflation” which meant there were economic stagnation and high inflation at the same time.

This phenomenon could not be explained by Keynes’s theory, so monetary school that criticized Keynes attracted attention. In essence, the monetary school advocates to returning to classical economics that the value of money derives from goods and the increase in the quantity of money out of line with the increasing in the quantity of goods will only cause inflation. The goal of monetary policy should not be to stimulate economic growth, but to control inflation and create a stable environment for economic growth. Since then, in western countries this view of monetary of school has generally been accepted.

However, because inflation does have the effect of stimulating economic growth temporarily, and the democratic election institution in western countries makes the politicians have the pressure to boost economic performance temporarily in election year, so central bankers cannot help but increasing money supply to create a moderate inflation under the pressure from politicians, which has been an open secret known to all. In fact, democracy encourages politicians to tend to take short-sighted actions, and developed countries are willing to create a moderate inflation even if there is no imminent fiscal crisis. It is precisely why a moderate inflation below 10% has become such a common phenomenon in modern economy. It is also why Friedman as the leader of monetary school advocates the monetary policy of “single rule” that stipulates that the money supply should be increased at a long-term fixed growth rate (consistent with the long-term average growth rate of real economy). He had been trying to push for the “single rule” to be written into the constitution of US so as not to be influenced by politicians, and he failed.
