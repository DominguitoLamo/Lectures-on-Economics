# Section 8: The Quantity Theory of Money

In this section, the second difficulty will be discussed. Even though the monetary authorities are willing to abide by discipline and do not overprint money, they actually do not know what the quantity of money is.

The example in section 3 is extremely simplified to illustrate the cause of inflation. If there are 100 units of goods, only 100 units of money should be issued. If the quantity of goods increases by 10% to 110 units, the quantity of money should also increase by 10% to 110 units. There will be no inflation. In reality, the problem is not that simple. Firstly, how to measure the quantity of goods? Different goods have different units of measurement, how to add up the quantity of goods with different units? Secondly, how to measure the quantity of money? It seems easier to measure the quantity of money than of goods, because money has a unified unit of measurement, but there is different difficulty in measuring the quantity of money.

From classical economics to neoclassical economics, it is quantity theory of money that has been prevailing. Fisher and Marshall had put forward “Fisher Equation”[^1] and “Cambridge Equation” respectively, and they are logically similar, so we only introduce Fisher equation here: PQ＝MV.

The left side of this equation reflects the monetary value of real economy and can be understood as the demand for money, because P is the price level (the average price per unit of good), and Q is the quantity of goods, which means there are so many goods in real economy that demand so much money. The right side of the equation reflects the quantity of money supplied. M is the quantity of money issued into the economy, and V is the times of turnover per unit of money (the velocity of circulation of money). Suppose one pays a bill of RMB100 in a transaction, it means this bill facilitates the transaction worth RMB100. The seller uses the bill to pay another transaction, which means the bill facilitates another transaction worth RMB100. Therefore, a bill can exchange for much more than the face value of it in a certain period of time, and should be multiplied by the times of changing hands.

Fisher equation is a tautology, so it must be true. The left side of the equation is actually the perspective of the buyer (how much has been spent to buy a good), while the right side of the equation is the perspective of the seller (how much has been received for selling a good), so it reflects the same transaction. If the equation is rewritten as $P = M∙\frac{V}{Q}$, under the constraint that the quantity of goods in real economy and the velocity of circulation of money are basically stable in short run, it is clear that the change in the quantity of money (M) will directly cause the change in the price level (P), which is precisely the mathematical expression on the cause of inflation.

However, if the quantity of goods in real economy and the velocity of circulation of money are not stable, what is the proper quantity of money in line with the quantity of goods? It is a difficult problem. For example, when there is super-inflation, people will exchange paper money for goods as soon as possible, so the velocity of circulation of money will be much higher than normal, which will intensify inflation.
