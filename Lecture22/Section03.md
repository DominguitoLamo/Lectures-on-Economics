# Section 3: The Determinants of Economic Performance

The examples in Section 1 and Section 2 show that there are the determinants of economic performance:

(1) The productive capacity of wealth in the real economy

According to the theory of interest, real wealth is the sum of the discounted value of future income, and asset is anything that can bring future income because it has productive capacity. Even if the value of wealth is depreciated, as long as there is productive capacity, the negative effect on economic growth may only be temporary.
The traditional economic growth theories attribute the source of sustained economic growth to technological progress, because increasing investment in capital or labor can just lead to economic growth for a while. According to the law of diminishing marginal product/return, the increase in the input of any production factors will finally lead to the economic growth slowing down. By contrast, technological progress can break through the constraint of this iron law by increasing the productivity of wealth. The increase in the input of capital or labor can just move the point along the same curve of marginal product, while technological progress can move the whole curve to the right.

By the way, Keynes put forward the law of diminishing marginal propensity to consume to explain the insufficiency of aggregate demand caused by insufficient consumption, and put forward the law of diminishing marginal efficiency of capital to explain that caused by insufficient investment. The latter law is actually an implication of the law of diminishing marginal return, but Keynes completely forgot the role of technological progress, without which breaking through the constraint of this law, the human society should have been downgraded to as poor as animals’.

(2) People’s expectation/confidence

Wealth is not living thing, so it depends on human to make use of its productive capacity. If people are pessimistic about the future, as mentioned in Lecture 21, they will take defensive measures of buying insurance that is not helpful to increasing future output. What is more, the assets (wealth) that are easy to flow will flow out of the country, thus directly reducing the wealth within a country.

(3) Whether the fictitious economy is out of line with the real economy.

As mentioned in Lecture 19, the fictitious economy is created by human to facilitate the real economy, or more clearly to reduce the transaction cost of the real economy. However, the value of the fictitious economy is derived from the real economy, so if the fictitious economy is out of line with the real economy, people will be misled in decision-making based on the real economy, which means there is increase in information cost, so people are unable to make the best use of the productive capacity of wealth, resulting in a decline in output or poor economic performance.

The cause of the Southeast Asian financial crisis in 1997 was that the exchange rates between the currencies of the Southeast Asian countries and the US dollar were overvalued before the crisis, which was out of line with their economic strength. After the currencies depreciated to be in line with their economic strength, the governments did not increase expenditure as Keynes’ theory suggested, so the economy recovered quickly.

The cause of the financial turmoil of the US in 2008 was that the high-risk subprime mortgage and the financial innovation of asset securitization led to excessive issuance of “toxic assets” that was out of line with the real economy of the real estate market. As long as there are still toxic assets in financial system, the financial market is out of line with the real estate market, and the economy cannot recover.

The cause of the European sovereign debt crisis since 2009 was that the exchange rate of euro was too high for the “PIIGS” with weak competitiveness, which means the exchange rate of euro was out of line with the real economy of PIIGS, similar to the financial Southeast Asian crisis in 1997. However, the Southeast Asian countries have their own currencies, so their economy can quickly recover by depreciating their currencies to be in line with their economic strength. By contrast, PIIGS do not have their own currencies, so the only way to solve this problem is to strengthen their economy to be in line with the strong euro.

For example, suppose the average price of the Greek products is 2 euro, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and Euro is 1:1, so the average price of the Greek products is 2 dollars in the international market. And suppose the average price of Chinese products comparable with the Greek products is 1 dollar, it is obvious that Greek products cannot compete with Chinese ones. If Greece had its own currency, it could depreciate its currency to the exchange rate of 1:2, which meant the average price of the Greek products would become 1 dollar in the international market now, so they could compete with the Chinese ones. But as a member of Eurozone, Greece has no right to depreciate Euro. What should it do? It can just try to reduce the average price of the products to 1 euro, so that even if the exchange rate remains 1:1, the average price of Greek products in the international market can fall to 1 dollar, and they can compete with the Chinese ones. How can the average price of Greek products be reduced to 1 euro? It is necessary to cut costs, including lowering the price (wage) of the labor force, so it is necessary to abolish the minimum wage law, the trade unions with administrative monopoly, and cut social welfare to reduce the cost burden on enterprises. Even if social welfare is borne by government, the cost is actually paid by taxpayers including enterprises and individuals. Obviously, it needs a painful and lengthy major reform of the institutional and economic structure, which cannot be achieved overnight.

(4) The proportion of transaction cost to national income or social wealth.

In fact, the determinants of (2) and (3) are also related to transaction cost. People are pessimistic about future, which implies the risk (transaction costs) rise. The fictitious economy is out of line with the real economy, which means the function of the fictitious economy facilitating the real economy does not well, or there is an increase in institutional cost (transaction cost). Combined with the determinant of (1), it is easy to understand that there is objectively the productive capacity of wealth, but human may not be able to fully make use of it due to the constraints of technique (the factor in nature science) and transaction cost (the factor in social science).

However, the effect of transaction cost on making use of the productive capacity of wealth is not limited to the determinants of (2) and (3). In reality, if the transaction cost is so high to affect the economic performance, the most common case is the ineffective protection of PPRs. There is an example of one’s knowing how to grow grain on stones in Lecture 17, which has well demonstrated how the transaction cost caused by the lack of protection of PPRs prevents people from making use of the productive capacity of wealth (including the technology and the stones).

After all, it is only a fictitious example. Here is another example in reality. When China has just reformed and opened up, there have been some Hong Kong-invested enterprises that set up factories in the Pearl River Delta region. At the beginning, the Chinese government did not allow them to recruit workers freely. Instead, the government sent the “state employees” to work in the factories. The working hours and wages of the state employees were decided by government, and the Hong Kong investors cannot fire them. Therefore, the state employees worked loosely and took a long nap at noon. Finally, the Hong Kong-invested enterprises refused to hire state employees and strived to hire “contract workers” by piece-wage contract. The situation changed greatly immediately: the factory did not open until 8:00, but the workers were already waiting outside at 7:00. Not only did they never take a nap at noon, but also they wanted to work overtime when it was time to get off work. The output increased by more than double. In the mid-1980s, the economic growth rate of many regions in Guangdong was over 50% every year! The institution of employment changed from “state employees” to “contract workers”, which implies the PPRs of labor have been clearly delineated, so the transaction cost has been greatly reduced, and both the productivity of wealth (labor) and economic growth rate have rapidly risen.

Ineffective protection of PPRs will lead to an increase in transaction cost, which is actually due to rent dissipation. The relevant analysis will be introduced in detail in the later lectures.

As mentioned in Lecture 21, the “permanent income” in Friedman’s “permanent-income hypothesis” is actually the “annuity” introduced in Lecture 18. If the economic performance is reflected by wealth changes, Fisher’s wealth equation $W = \frac{Y}{r}$ can be adopted to analyze this issue.

The expansionary fiscal policy advocated by Keynes is to increase national income (Y) several times by increasing government expenditure, which has been criticized that government expenditure can only increase temporary income, neither can affect temporary consumption nor permanent income (annuity), so cannot increase permanent consumption.

How about expansionary monetary policy? According to Fisher’s wealth equation, when income (Y) falls sharply due to the outbreak of economic crisis, if interest rate (r) does not fall or falls even further, wealth (W) will fall sharply. Therefore, the logic of expansionary monetary policy is to increase money supply to make interest rate (the price in monetary market or capital market) fall at least as much as income, so as to keep wealth unchanged, thus ensuring that consumption and investment expenditures will not decrease. However, if monetary policy is used to influence interest rate instead of stabilizing monetary value, it will cause the fictitious economy out of line with the real economy sooner or later, which will bring more adverse consequences. What is more, as has been pointed out in Lecture 19, if people are pessimistic about the future, the effective money supply in the economy may not increase due to expansionary monetary policy.

The key to boosting the economy is to change people’s expectation of future income, the essence of which is to increase permanent income. The general principle is to reduce transaction cost, one of the results of which is expectation change. What government can change most effectively is the expectation of enterprises, because by abolishing the minimum wage law and other evil laws that interfere with the operation of enterprises, enterprises will reverse their pessimistic expectations for the future, thus expanding production and increasing supply.

According to the theory of national income determination, all the Keynes’ policy suggestions focus on increasing aggregate demand. However, according to the Say’s Law, increasing supply can automatically create demand, as long as there is not wrong monetary policy so that money remains neutral. Of course, it is not government that increases supply, but enterprises that have changed the pessimistic expectations, which can stimulate effective investment expenditure. In order to produce, enterprises must first purchase all kinds of production factors, which immediately increases employment and the incomes of the owners of all kinds of factors (including workers who are the owners of labor), so that the owners can increase consumption expenditure. The incomes obtained by the owners of these factors are permanent income, because as long as enterprises keep producing, they will keep purchasing production factors and providing income to the owners. By contrast, there may be government’s investment this year, but there may not the next year. If government keeps investing, it will replace enterprises’ production, which means the planned economy will replace the market economy.

In fact, there is an anti-Keynes school called “Supply-side School”, and the essence of which is precisely the idea of Say’s Law.
